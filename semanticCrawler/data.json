With the increasing need for developing self-adaptive systems, providing a model and an implementation platform to facilitate integration of adaptation mechanisms into the systems and assuring their safety and quality is crucial. In this paper, we target Track-based Traffic Control Systems (TTCSs) in which the traffic flows through pre-specified sub-tracks and is coordinated by a traffic controller. We introduce a coordinated actor model to design self-adaptive TTCSs and provide a general mapping between various TTCSs and the coordinated actor model. The coordinated actor model is extended to build large-scale self-adaptive TTCSs in a decentralized setting. We also discuss the benefits of using Ptolemy II as a framework for model-based development of large-scale self-adaptive systems that supports designing multiple hierarchical MAPE-K feedback loops interacting with each other. We propose a template based on the coordinated actor model to design a self-adaptive TTCS in Ptolemy II that can be instantiated for various TTCSs. We enhance the proposed template with a predictive adaptation feature. We illustrate applicability of the coordinated actor model and consequently the proposed template by designing two real-life case studies in the domains of air traffic control systems and railway traffic control systems in Ptolemy II.", "references": ["A-survey-on-engineering-approaches-for-systems-Krupitzer-Roth/d64163ac9d7ad5bffda3d2cb78bd56319d65cfb6", "Stochastic-game-analysis-and-latency-awareness-for-C%C3%A1mara-Moreno/719a78cc3e88ee775d4b3a0c8232763abfcd4150", "Probabilistic-Verification-at-Runtime-for-Systems-Filieri-Tamburrelli/49a2b8f197272e34c5a174e303b7159e864019aa", "Incremental-Runtime-Verification-of-Probabilistic-Forejt-Kwiatkowska/0aff76e19803943175c4dd293ce51e7f97e08ad8", "Run-time-efficient-probabilistic-model-checking-Filieri-Ghezzi/74caebaafddeb27814f6f572638ffbaf6872b762", "A-Component-Architecture-for-the-Internet-of-Things-Brooks-Jerady/c5752fb41feb1be2a1c8c88650351867f1bea50e", "Comparing-Model-Based-Predictive-Approaches-to-and-Moreno-Papadopoulos/bd5902a7526ba71beb25cd428bb844c37cddb47a", "Formal-Design-and-Verification-of-Self-Adaptive-Arcaini-Riccobene/c3681656b53cea3cd9e9854a1be082c2d3cc4d50", "Adaptation-impact-and-environment-models-for-C%C3%A1mara-Lopes/8641be8daff5b24e98a0d68138a61456853aef82", "Coordinated-Actors-for-Reliable-Self-adaptive-Bagheri-Akkaya/861de9c40b7734ddba735a8edb4599a87b8887bb"]},

One way to reduce the number of data misses or their effect is data prefetching. As data accesses have high temporal correlations, temporal prefetching techniques are promising for them. While state-of-the-art temporal prefetching techniques are effective at reducing the number of data misses, we observe that there is a significant gap between what they offer and the opportunity. This work aims to improve the effectiveness of temporal prefetching techniques. We identify the lookup mechanism of existing temporal prefetchers responsible for the large gap between what they offer and the opportunity. Existing lookup mechanisms either not choose the right stream in the history, or unnecessarily delay the stream selection, and hence, miss the opportunity at the beginning of every stream. In this work, we introduce Domino prefetching to address the limitations of existing temporal prefetchers. Domino prefetcher is a temporal data prefetching technique that logically looks up the history with both one and two last miss addresses to find a match for prefetching. We propose a practical design for Domino prefetcher that employs an Enhanced Index Table that is indexed by just a single miss address. We show that Domino prefetcher captures more than 90% of the temporal opportunity. Through detailed evaluation targeting a quad-core processor and a set of server workloads, we show that Domino prefetcher improves system performance by 16% over the baseline with no data prefetcher and 6% over the state-of- the-art temporal data prefetcher.", "references": ["Identifying-Hierarchical-Structure-in-Sequences%3A-A-Nevill-Manning-Witten/02aca8223525caa99efc4b0e2810e450ee6776ba", "Clearing-the-clouds%3A-a-study-of-emerging-scale-out-Ferdman-Adileh/8b10b13fb495101d1e4eb768907cff05e3bd9315", "Practical-off-chip-meta-data-for-temporal-memory-Wenisch-Ferdman/2b51020e54a6361316cc477c39a2759902022580", "Temporal-memory-streaming-Wenisch/adc43c28e86d5f577e3b4b2ff120162a7225b1f0", "Data-cache-prefetching-using-a-global-history-Nesbit-Smith/3933d3380710680865441c87a22d691ba751a2ef", "Performance-of-Database-Workloads-on-Shared-Memory-Ranganathan-Gharachorloo/04dba1bd51e8f3348c57cb7b5148abd9f4b5aa21", "Linearizing-irregular-memory-accesses-for-improved-Jain-Lin/2aed1e5dab68713bf8ed0fb4b35a0ec67b087c30", "Spatio-temporal-memory-streaming-Somogyi-Wenisch/048336a0dc1029416ce47c78b9a5cba8422e6efd", "Temporal-streams-in-commercial-server-applications-Wenisch-Ferdman/293e7c79a37798032b3047324d101bc49d9a37a2", "Dynamic-Hot-Data-Stream-Prefetching-for-Programs-Chilimbi-Hirzel/60b85b7ee655397a4d2202f9cdf6dd5e3f04f6fd"]},

Self-adaptation has proven to be an effective way to engineer systems that can address such challenges, but many of these approaches are purely reactive and adapt only after a failure has taken place. To overcome some of the limitations of reactive approaches (e.g., lagging behind environment changes and favoring short-term improvements), recent proactive self-adaptation mechanisms apply ideas from control theory, such as model predictive control (MPC), to improve adaptation. When selecting which MPC approach to apply, the improvement that can be obtained with each approach is scenario-dependent, and so guidance is needed to better understand how to choose an approach for a givensituation. In this paper, we compare CobRA and PLA, two approaches that are inspired by MPC. CobRA is a requirements-based approach that applies control theory, whereas PLA is architecture-based and applies stochastic analysis.

The discussion is supported by a realistic example and by empirical experiments.", "references": ["Probabilistic-reachability-for-parametric-Markov-Hahn-Hermanns/a589c1d97cc6dd8309ab55c93c8545133b46c74e", "Principles-of-model-checking-Baier-Katoen/f1269591359fddc20f95da10c7bd4c054080b447", "Symbolic-and-Parametric-Model-Checking-of-Markov-Daws/02d2ba3cdd5ea699bfe65cb5d7d75f1537aacb77", "Discrete-Time-Rewards-Model-Checked-Andova-Hermanns/f1b3103dc7559da8b02aedb98de4fec92c9cc106", "Further-steps-towards-efficient-runtime-Handling-Filieri-Ghezzi/6b1aca12dceee66384ea76a9f6850990cd42f36a", "Dynamic-QoS-Management-and-Optimization-in-Systems-Calinescu-Grunske/8c02ee09831be4dcade70f3d0e846412da61cc59", "Incremental-quantitative-verification-for-Markov-Kwiatkowska-Parker/13d1d33df37c252b14073caf03b841edd37ae5bf", "Architectural-Issues-of-Adaptive-Pervasive-Systems-Caporuscio-Funaro/ca0affc58733eb6e50997c0d9bf1dda856769d39"]},

In reactive adaptation, ignoring adaptation tactic latency can lead to suboptimal adaptation decisions (e.g., activating a server that takes more time to boot than the transient spike in traffic that triggered its activation). In proactive adaptation, taking adaptation latency into account is necessary to get the system into the desired state to deal with an upcoming situation. In this paper, we introduce a formal analysis technique based on model checking of stochastic multiplayer games (SMGs) that enables us to quantify the potential benefits of employing dierent types of algorithms for self-adaptation. In particular, we apply this technique to show the potential benefit of considering adaptation tactic latency in proactive adaptation algorithms.

In this paper, we address these shortcomings by describing an approach to the specification of impact models based on architectural system descriptions, which at the same time allows us to represent both variability and uncertainty in the outcome of adaptations, hence improving the selection of the best corrective action. The core of our approach is a language equipped with a formal semantics defined in terms of Discrete Time Markov Chains that enables us to describe both the impact of adaptation tactics, as well as the assumptions about the environment.

They show that a maxmin guarantee (1-$\\MMS$ allocation) is not always possible even when the number of agents is limited to 3. While the existence of an approximation solution (e.g. a $1/2$-$\\MMS$ allocation) is quite straightforward, improving the guarantee becomes subtler for larger constants. \\sprocacciafirst ~\\citeProcaccia:first provide a proof for the existence of a $2/3$-$\\MMS$ allocation and leave the question open for better guarantees. Our main contribution is an answer to the above question. We improve the result of \\sprocacciafirst~to a $3/4$ factor in the additive setting. The main idea for our $3/4$-$\\MMS$ allocation method is clustering the agents. To this end, we introduce three notions and techniques, namely reducibility, matching allocation, and cycle-envy-freeness, and prove the approximation guarantee of our algorithm via non-trivial applications of these techniques. Our analysis involves coloring and double counting arguments that might be of independent interest. One major shortcoming of the current studies on fair allocation is the additivity assumption on the valuations. We alleviate this by extending our results to the case of submodular, fractionally subadditive, and subadditive settings. More precisely, we give constant approximation guarantees for submodular and XOS agents, and a logarithmic approximation for the case of subadditive agents. Furthermore, we complement our results by providing close upper bounds for each class of valuation functions. Finally, we present algorithms to find such allocations for additive, submodular, and XOS settings in polynomial time.

In this paper, we present a hybrid approach for breaking down large, complex deep models for cooperative, privacy-preserving analytics.

While sophisti cated prefetching techniques have been automated for limited domains, such as scientific codes that access dense arrays in loop nests, a similar level of success has eluded general-purpose pro grams, especially pointer-chasing codes written in languages such as C and C++. We address this problem by describing, implementing and evaluating a dynamic prefetching scheme. Our technique runs on stock hardware, is completely automatic, and works for general-purpose programs, including pointer-chasing codes written in weakly-typed languages, such as C and C++. It operates in three phases. First, the profiling phase gathers a temporal data reference profile from a running program with low-overhead. Next, the profiling is turned off and a fast analysis algorithm extracts hot data streams, which are data reference sequences that frequently repeat in the same order, from the temporal profile. Then, the system dynamically injects code at appropriate program points to detect and prefetch these hot data streams. Finally, the process enters the hibernation phase where no profiling or analysis is performed, and the program continues to execute with the added prefetch instructions. At the end of the hibernation phase, the program is de-optimized to remove the inserted checks and prefetch instructions, and control returns to the profiling phase. For long-running programs, this profile, analyze and optimize, hibernate, cycle will repeat multiple times. Our initial results from applying dynamic prefetching are promising, indicating overall execution time improvements of 5.19% for several memory-performance-limited SPECint2000 benchmarks running their largest (ref) inputs.", "references": ["ATOM-A-System-for-Building-Customized-Program-Tools-Srivastava-Eustace/0557beb82bd471232c4fe2c06de9a05edb58d665"]},

As a consequence of this success, the energetic demand of the infrastructure may lead to relevant economical costs and environmental footprint. Thus, the search for power optimization is of primary importance. In this perspective, this paper introduces an energy-aware consolidation strategy based on predictive control, in which virtual machines are properly migrated among physical machines to reduce the amount of active units. To this aim, a discrete-time dynamic model and suitable constraints are introduced to describe the cloud. The migration strategies are obtained by solving finite-horizon optimal control problems involving integer variables. The proposed method allows one to trade among power savings and violations of the service level agreement. To prove its effectiveness, a simulation campaign is conducted in different scenarios using both synthetic and real workloads, also by performing a comparison with three heuristics selected from the reference literature.", "references": ["Heterogeneity-aware-dominant-resource-assistant-for-Zhang-Ansari/a7aa56d34a963deee74178a0ff23e333401907eb", "Adaptive-threshold-based-approach-for-consolidation-Beloglazov-Buyya/502caa83bdcc2352fa926a304440913f866191a9", "Energy-Aware-Consolidation-for-Cloud-Computing-Srikantaiah-Zhao/56ea3597157481cc3f93048c6c1a225f6d2808ca", "Server-storage-virtualization%3A-Integration-and-load-Singh-Korupolu/fcb8086eec2c6309db40078338d64981eee34f19", "Greening-of-the-internet-Gupta-Singh/727dfd1f3f920e3ff38e0a401ac4c33d7f87d644", "Dynamic-Heterogeneity-Aware-Resource-Provisioning-*-vishali/9864b064ef0a8bf7aaa5cc2091568a3633e534cf", "A-predictive-control-approach-for-energy-aware-of-Gaggero-Caviglione/7a6c83299e60c2734c1686155a1e3c92d2d27431", "A-predictive-control-approach-for-energy-aware-of-Gaggero-Caviglione/13544bf13c07ceea2fd26dc4939d60a5c898c8a5", "Analysis%2C-Modeling-and-Simulation-of-Workload-in-a-Moreno-Garraghan/69ed66747331bd13d347ced3da2cfd6229b1d94f"]},

However, the evaluation of a proposed auto-scaler is usually achieved through experiments under specific conditions and seldom includes extensive testing to account for uncertainties in the workloads and unexpected behaviors of the system. These tests by no means can provide guarantees about the behavior of the system in general conditions. In this article, we present a Performance Evaluation framework for Auto-Scaling (PEAS) strategies in the presence of uncertainties. The evaluation is formulated as a chance constrained optimization problem, which is solved using scenario theory. The adoption of such a technique allows one to give probabilistic guarantees of the obtainable performance. Six different auto-scaling strategies have been selected from the literature for extensive test evaluation and compared using the proposed framework. We build a discrete event simulator and parameterize it based on real experiments. Using the simulator, each auto-scaler\u2019s performance is evaluated using 796 distinct real workload traces from projects hosted on the Wikimedia foundations\u2019 servers, and their performance is compared using PEAS.

In Unity, an autonomic element within each application environment computes a resource-level utility function based on information specified in that application\u00fds service-level utility function. Resource-level utility functions from multiple application environments are sent to a Resource Arbiter element, which computes a globally optimal allocation of servers across the applications.

In reaction to changes in the environment, these systems determine the appropriate corrective actions based in part on information about which action will have the best impact on the system. Existing models used to describe the impact of adaptations are either unable to capture the underlying uncertainty and variability of such dynamic environments, or are not compositional and described at a level of abstraction too low to scale in terms of specification effort required for non-trivial systems. In this paper, we address these shortcomings by describing an approach to the specification of impact models based on architectural system descriptions, which at the same time allows us to represent both variability and uncertainty in the outcome of adaptations, hence improving the selection of the best corrective action. The core of our approach is an impact model language equipped with a formal semantics defined in terms of Discrete Time Markov Chains. To validate our approach, we show how employing our language can improve the accuracy of predictions used for decisionmaking in the Rainbow framework for architecture-based self-adaptation.", "references": ["Self-adaptive-software-needs-quantitative-at-Calinescu-Ghezzi/12965802d2c962b03acc03aa1cb9af6649e75ef3", "PRISM-4.0%3A-Verification-of-Probabilistic-Real-Time-Kwiatkowska-Norman/5b9631561a89a3e071d8ec386a616a120220bfd9", "Cost-Based-Optimization-of-Service-Compositions-*-Prakash-Rajeswari/54c04829e5d9f674faa9c144458f2ebd3502f7be", "Brownout%3A-building-more-robust-cloud-applications-Klein-Maggio/248bdda09f6c83460fd8aa2f12d5e82cc000dba4", "Learning-revised-models-for-planning-in-adaptive-Sykes-Corapi/517a0504f1bb3206cc4d155b8e27d382e999c56d", "Self-Management-of-Adaptable-Component-Based-Rosa-Rodrigues/9b70d25a07e5fdddedc9d65ae43b5cf38fa10cd0", "Stitch%3A-A-language-for-architecture-based-Cheng-Garlan/09e2f1dcc308494f8c1c14e1ec5b5a4256cf6643", "Self-adaptive-software-meets-control-theory%3A-A-Filieri-Ghezzi/05a8036af51742a6613220c604fb1ef598964f15", "Uncertainty-in-Self-Adaptive-Software-Systems-Esfahani-Malek/4d0877a28ea3692b2c0955a11d2490d17efbb2d0"]},

The unprecedented accuracy of deep learning methods has turned them into the foundation of new AI-based services on the Internet. Commercial companies that collect user data on a large scale have been the main beneficiaries of this trend since the success of deep learning techniques is directly proportional to the amount of data available for training. Massive data collection required for deep learning presents obvious privacy issues. Users' personal, highly sensitive data such as photos and voice recordings is kept indefinitely by the companies that collect it. Users can neither delete it, nor restrict the purposes for which it is used. Furthermore, centrally kept data is subject to legal subpoenas and extra-judicial surveillance. Many data owners--for example, medical institutions that may want to apply deep learning methods to clinical records--are prevented by privacy and confidentiality concerns from sharing the data and thus benefitting from large-scale deep learning.\n In this paper, we design, implement, and evaluate a practical system that enables multiple parties to jointly learn an accurate neural-network model for a given objective without sharing their input datasets. We exploit the fact that the optimization algorithms used in modern deep learning, namely, those based on stochastic gradient descent, can be parallelized and executed asynchronously. Our system lets participants train independently on their own datasets and selectively share small subsets of their models' key parameters during training. This offers an attractive point in the utility/privacy tradeoff space: participants preserve the privacy of their respective data while still benefitting from other participants' models and thus boosting their learning accuracy beyond what is achievable solely on their own inputs. We demonstrate the accuracy of our privacy-preserving deep learning on benchmark datasets.", "references": ["Torch-7-%3A-A-Matlab-like-Environment-for-Machine-Collobert-Kavukcuoglu/6074c1108997e0c1f97dc3c199323a162ffe978d"]},

The method can be used for recognition or verification applications where the number of categories is very large and not known during training, and where the number of training samples for a single category is very small. The idea is to learn a function that maps input patterns into a target space such that the L/sub 1/ norm in the target space approximates the \"semantic\" distance in the input space. The method is applied to a face verification task.

We crawled 0.5 million images of celebrities from IMDB and Wikipedia that we make public. This is the largest public dataset for age prediction to date. We pose the age regression problem as a deep classification problem followed by a softmax expected value refinement and show improvements over direct regression training of CNNs. Our proposed method, Deep EXpectation (DEX) of apparent age, first detects the face in the test image and then extracts the CNN predictions from an ensemble of 20 networks on the cropped face. The CNNs of DEX were finetuned on the crawled images and then on the provided images with apparent age annotations. DEX does not use explicit facial landmarks.

This has motivated the development of self-adaptive software systems. Self-adaptation endows a software system with the ability to satisfy certain objectives by automatically modifying its behavior at runtime. While many promising approaches for the construction of self-adaptive software systems have been developed, the majority of them ignore the uncertainty underlying the adaptation. This has been one of the key inhibitors to widespread adoption of self-adaption techniques in risk-averse real-world applications. Uncertainty in this setting is a vaguely understood term. In this paper, we characterize the sources of uncertainty in self-adaptive software system, and demonstrate its impact on the system\u2019s ability to satisfy its objectives.

We then transform it into a fully homomorphic encryption scheme using standard \u201csquashing\u201d and \u201cbootstrapping\u201d techniques introduced by Gentry (STOC 2009). One of the obstacles in going from \u201csomewhat\u201d to full homomorphism is the requirement that the somewhat homomorphic scheme be circular secure, namely, the scheme can be used to securely encrypt its own secret key. For all known somewhat homomorphic encryption schemes, this requirement was not known to be achievable under any cryptographic assumption, and had to be explicitly assumed. We take a step forward towards removing this additional assumption by proving that our scheme is in fact secure when encrypting polynomial functions of the secret key. Our scheme is based on the ring learning with errors (RLWE) assumption that was recently introduced by Lyubashevsky, Peikert and Regev (Eurocrypt 2010). The RLWE assumption is reducible to worst-case problems on ideal lattices, and allows us to completely abstract out the lattice interpretation, resulting in an extremely simple scheme. For example, our secret key is s, and our public key is (a, b = as+ 2e), where s, a, e are all degree (n\u2212 1) integer polynomials whose coefficients are independently drawn from easy to sample distributions.", "references": ["Efficient-Circuit-Size-Independent-Public-Key-with-Malkin-Teranishi/a86074a8c81056ba1d733fd6b94f5da6329da3c3", "Fast-Cryptographic-Primitives-and-Circular-Secure-Applebaum-Cash/0b84bcbdeb05d84950ebc36ba9df53fb1cb0aa8e", "Circular-Secure-Encryption-from-Decision-Boneh-Halevi/06281db53ad9f1c7a35a4de5f331f66a15dd6b48", "On-lattices%2C-learning-with-errors%2C-random-linear-Regev/997f6949599b0db10f62ad3fe2b319a3bef1918f", "Implementing-Gentry's-Fully-Homomorphic-Encryption-Gentry-Halevi/8cb75cbb89d168152b791f960d30df5b737c0011", "Fully-Homomorphic-Encryption-with-Relatively-Small-Smart-Vercauteren/68224fb1dc69dfc391eb330d9dc77e46c4165842", "On-Ideal-Lattices-and-Learning-with-Errors-over-Lyubashevsky-Peikert/39bd1f1f75ca061985833f7f1d339ace60047f45", "Efficient-Fully-Homomorphic-Encryption-from-LWE-Brakerski-Vaikuntanathan/1adb3d8e471f4f74c391d0ffcdaeb30b654b333c", "Homomorphic-Encryption%3A-from-Private-Key-to-Rothblum/3b5a6bd5038ee41be7d7f0d49d6efcd7b2d2b6e2"]},

Lauter", "Michael Naehrig", "Vinod Vaikuntanathan"], "date": "2011", "abstract": "The prospect of outsourcing an increasing amount of data storage and management to cloud services raises many new privacy concerns for individuals and businesses alike. The privacy concerns can be satisfactorily addressed if users encrypt the data they send to the cloud. If the encryption scheme is homomorphic, the cloud can still perform meaningful computations on the data, even though it is encrypted.\n In fact, we now know a number of constructions of fully homomorphic encryption schemes that allow arbitrary computation on encrypted data. In the last two years, solutions for fully homomorphic encryption have been proposed and improved upon, but it is hard to ignore the elephant in the room, namely efficiency -- can homomorphic encryption ever be efficient enough to be practical? Certainly, it seems that all known fully homomorphic encryption schemes have a long way to go before they can be used in practice. Given this state of affairs, our contribution is two-fold.\n First, we exhibit a number of real-world applications, in the medical, financial, and the advertising domains, which require only that the encryption scheme is \"somewhat\" homomorphic. Somewhat homomorphic encryption schemes, which support a limited number of homomorphic operations, can be much faster, and more compact than fully homomorphic encryption schemes.\n Secondly, we show a proof-of-concept implementation of the recent somewhat homomorphic encryption scheme of Brakerski and Vaikuntanathan, whose security relies on the \"ring learning with errors\" (Ring LWE) problem. The scheme is very efficient, and has reasonably short ciphertexts. Our unoptimized implementation in magma enjoys comparable efficiency to even optimized pairing-based schemes with the same level of security and homomorphic capacity. We also show a number of application-specific optimizations to the encryption scheme, most notably the ability to convert between different message encodings in a ciphertext.", "references": []},

However, despite advances in automatic age estimation, it remains a challenging problem. This is because the face aging process is determined not only by intrinsic factors, e.g. genetic factors, but also by extrinsic factors, e.g. lifestyle, expression, and environment. As a result, different people with the same age can have quite different appearances due to different rates of facial aging. We propose a hierarchical approach for automatic age estimation, and provide an analysis of how aging influences individual facial components. Experimental results on the FG-NET, MORPH Album2, and PCSO databases show that eyes and nose are more informative than the other facial components in automatic age estimation.

Unlike prior methods using complex models with strong parametric assumptions to model the aging process, we use a data-driven method to address this problem.

By leveraging a large-scale image dataset freely available on the Internet as a reference set, CARC is able to encode the low-level feature of a face image with an ageinvariant reference space. In the testing phase, the proposed method only requires a linear projection to encode the feature and therefore it is highly scalable. To thoroughly evaluate our work, we introduce a new large-scale dataset for face recognition and retrieval across age called Cross-Age Celebrity Dataset (CACD). The dataset contains more than 160,000 images of 2,000 celebrities with age ranging from 16 to 62. To the best of our knowledge, it is by far the largest publicly available crossage face dataset.

Here, we address this problem by making the following contributions. First, in answer to one of the key problems of age estimation research-absence of data-we offer a unique data set of face images, labeled for age and gender, acquired by smart-phones and other mobile devices, and uploaded without manual filtering to online image repositories. We show the images in our collection to be more challenging than those offered by other face-photo benchmarks. Second, we describe the dropout-support vector machine approach used by our system for face attribute estimation, in order to avoid over-fitting. This method, inspired by the dropout learning techniques now popular with deep belief networks, is applied here for training support vector machines, to the best of our knowledge, for the first time. Finally, we present a robust face alignment technique, which explicitly considers the uncertainties of facial feature detectors.

This fact stems from a key result derived in this paper, which relates at a fundamental level the reliability of the model to its complexity and to the amount of available information (number of observed data).", "references": ["Forecasting-economic-time-series-using-targeted-Bai-Ng/de4af94c12d2f5cd89f046859f63cfb19f49d6b4", "A-course-in-probability-theory-Chung/c2b3222f1d6ebe4b82bae6a4bde1ffc3a5121525", "The-scenario-approach-to-robust-control-design-Calafiore-Campi/459c0c4069b1cbbd3c188cbdac00f5fdecab1d9f", "Set-membership-prediction-of-nonlinear-time-series-Milanese-Novara/4c2f076a4759e07c6aa4254d1da60502fb5dc8a7", "Uncertain-convex-programs%3A-randomized-solutions-and-Calafiore-Campi/7180f301c27c4cb7ce0e0b759b34fe9eba5ea40f", "Set-Membership-identification-of-nonlinear-systems-Milanese-Novara/4ee794588e58946f4fb9cdf5ed06e4984587ef8c", "A-Learning-Theory-Approach-to-the-Construction-of-Calafiore-Campi/231b249b71f5f61f23a242c4cb9be0797537e2bc", "Guaranteed-robust-nonlinear-minimax-estimation-Jaulin-Walter/3d471a123bcfb215db03dff04feab08d36600c38"]},

We propose an approach geared to such systems, which continuously furnishes refined reliability predictions at runtime by incorporating various sources of information. The reliability predictions are leveraged to proactively place the software in the optimal configuration with respect to changing conditions. Our approach considers two representative architectural reconfiguration decisions that impact the system's reliability: reallocation of components to processes and changing the architectural style.

Leibo", "Youssef Mroueh", "Tomaso A. Poggio"], "date": "2013", "abstract": "The standard approach to unconstrained face recognition in natural photographs is via a detection, alignment, recognition pipeline. While that approach has achieved impressive results, there are several reasons to be dissatisfied with it, among them is its lack of biological plausibility. A recent theory of invariant recognition by feedforward hierarchical networks [1], like HMAX [2, 3], other convolutional networks (e.g., [4]), or possibly the ventral stream, implies an alternative approach to unconstrained face recognition. This approach accomplishes detection and alignment implicitly by storing transformations of training images (called templates) rather than explicitly detecting and aligning faces at test time. Here we propose a particular locality-sensitive hashing based voting scheme which we call \u201cconsensus of collisions\u201d and show that it can be used to approximate the full 3-layer hierarchy implied by the theory. The resulting end-to-end system for unconstrained face recognition operates on photographs of faces taken under natural conditions, e.g., Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) [5], without aligning or cropping them, as is normally done. It achieves a drastic improvement in the state of the art on this end-to-end task, reaching the same level of performance as the best systems operating on aligned, closely cropped images (no outside training data). It also performs well on two newer datasets, similar to LFW, but more difficult: LFW-jittered (new here) and SUFR-W [6].

Parkhi", "Andrea Vedaldi", "Andrew Zisserman"], "date": "2013", "abstract": "Overview. The face verification and recognition domain has mostly been dominated by carefully designed representations based on features computed around numerous facial landmarks [1, 3]. On the other hand, for image classification, image representations are capable of capturing discriminative image information without any domain-specific knowledge by using densely computed features, coupled with a non-linear encoding. For instance, the high-dimensional Fisher vector encoding [6] of SIFT features [5] achieves state-of-the-art performance on several image classification benchmarks [2]. In this paper, we address this discrepancy and make two contributions. First, we show that Fisher vector encoding of dense SIFT, an off-the-shelf image representation, achieves state-of-the-art face verification performance on the challenging \u201cLabeled Faces in the Wild\u201d (LFW) benchmark. Second, we show that the high-dimensional face representation using Fisher vector encoding is amenable to discriminative dimensionality reduction. The resulting compact descriptor has equal or better recognition accuracy and is very well suited to large-scale face recognition tasks. The overview of our face descriptor computation pipeline is shown in Fig. 2. The learnt dimensionality reduction model is visualised in Fig. 3. It is able to automatically extract the discriminative regions of the face.", "references": ["Labeled-Faces-in-the-Wild-%3A-A-Database-for-Studying-Huang-Mattar/370b5757a5379b15e30d619e4d3fb9e8e13f3256", "Probabilistic-Elastic-Matching-for-Pose-Variant-Li-Hua/224d0eee53c2aa5d426d2c9b7fa5d843a47cf1db", "Probabilistic-Models-for-Inference-about-Identity-Prince-Li/64cf1cda80a23ed6fc1c8e66065614ef7bdeadf3", "Improving-the-Fisher-Kernel-for-Large-Scale-Image-Perronnin-S%C3%A1nchez/659fc2a483a97dafb8fb110d08369652bbb759f9", "Is-that-you-Metric-learning-approaches-for-face-Guillaumin-Verbeek/19296e129c70b332a8c0a67af8990f2f4d4f44d1", "Distinctive-Image-Features-from-Scale-Invariant-Lowe/1a998506899da3bc703455bde45114bd4c228947", "Large-Scale-Strongly-Supervised-Ensemble-Metric-to-Huang-Zhu/17b2199b74f8d7de009e2acf4cc953cd11c81753", "Blessing-of-Dimensionality%3A-High-Dimensional-and-Chen-Cao/0ec1673609256b1e457f41ede5f21f05de0c054f", "Bayesian-Face-Revisited%3A-A-Joint-Formulation-Chen-Cao/a0d6390dd28d802152f207940c7716fe5fae8760", "Descriptor-Learning-Using-Convex-Optimisation-Simonyan-Vedaldi/d433b75aa66d1bc92a508201898a6752cdeb26de"]},

Our method was designed with an emphasis on robustness and efficiency - with the explicit goal of deployment in real-world applications which reconstruct and display faces in 3D. Our key observation is that for many practical applications, warping the shape of a reference face to match the appearance of a query, is enough to produce realistic impressions of the query's 3D shape. Doing so, however, requires matching visual features between the (possibly very different) query and reference images, while ensuring that a plausible face shape is produced. To this end, we describe an optimization process which seeks to maximize the similarity of appearances and depths, jointly, to those of a reference model. We describe our system for monocular face shape reconstruction and present both qualitative and quantitative experiments, comparing our method against alternative systems, and demonstrating its capabilities.

These negative results force us to modify our notion of `solvinga a given problem. An approach that is recently gaining popularity is that of using randomized algorithms, which can be used to solve a problem approximately, most of the time. We begin with the premise that many problems in robustness analysis and synthesis can be formulated as the minimization of an objective function with respect to the controller parameters. It is argued that, in order to assess the performance of a controller as the plant varies over a prespeci\"ed family, it is better to use the average performance of the controller as the objective function to be minimized, rather than its worst-case performance, as the worst-case objective function usually leads to rather conservative designs. Then it is shown that a property from statistical learning theory known as uniform convergence of empirical means (UCEM) plays an important role in allowing us to construct e$cient randomized algorithms for a wide variety of controller synthesis problems. In particular, whenever the UCEM property holds, there exists an e$cient (i.e., polynomial-time) randomized algorithm. Using very recent results in statistical learning theory, it is shown that the UCEM property holds in any problem in which the satisfaction of a performance constraint can be expressed in terms of a \"nite number of polynomial inequalities.

For consumer imaging applications, person recognition is an important tool that is useful for searching and retrieving images from a personal image collection. It has been shown that when recognizing a single person in an image, a maximum likelihood classifier requires the prior probability for each candidate individual. In this paper, we extend this idea and describe the benefits of using a group prior for identifying people in consumer images with multiple people. The group prior describes the probability of a group of individuals appearing together in an image. In our application, we have a subset of ambiguously labeled images for a consumer image collection, where we seek to identify all of the people in the collection. We describe a simple algorithm for resolving the ambiguous labels. We show that despite errors in resolving ambiguous labels, useful classifiers can be trained with the resolved labels. Recognition performance is further improved with a group prior learned from the ambiguous labels. In summary, by modeling the relationships between the people with the group prior, we improve classification performance.", "references": ["Leveraging-context-to-resolve-identity-in-photo-Naaman-Yeh/45467c70c1857b68902acebe6086d8d455f69f1d", "Efficient-propagation-for-face-annotation-in-family-Zhang-Hu/046bc0e9e76315f1b7d4a1c4754c890b1d43756d", "Names-and-faces-in-the-news-Berg-Berg/2fda164863a06a92d3a910b96eef927269aeb730", "Face-recognition%3A-A-literature-survey-Zhao-Chellappa/28312c3a47c1be3a67365700744d3d6665b86f22", "Fast-Multi-view-Face-Detection-Jones-Viola/548ab5770b89650158f99caee1bed3a986b0dcdf", "Constrained-K-means-Clustering-with-Background-Wagstaff-Cardie/0bacca0993a3f51649a6bb8dbb093fc8d8481ad4", "Grouping-with-Bias-Yu-Shi/00e271658883bb9d55d6ff0ddcc3b2ab73c33e11", "On-Spectral-Clustering%3A-Analysis-and-an-algorithm-Ng-Jordan/e0d2861a9022667a93a8a0573d44f238f7c3a027", "Statistical-Context-Priming-for-Object-Detection-Torralba-Sinha/f6a48c0dbff6e7fa752fdcf8ef34f8cba8202b41", "Data-Clustering%3A-A-Review-Jain-Murty/502ff2f9220ebc8c3544e6c4a005e819429ab716"]},

Our new LQP face representation not only outperforms any other representation on challenging face datasets but performs equally well in the intensity space and orientation space (obtained by applying gradient or Gabor Filters) and hence is intrinsically robust to illumination variations. Extensive experiments on two challenging face recognition datasets (FERET [14] and LFW [7]) show that this representation gives state-of-the-art performance (improving the earlier state-of-the-art by around 3%) without requiring neither a metric learning stage nor a costly labelled training dataset, having the comparison of two faces being made by simply computing the Cosine similarity between their LQP representations in a projected space.", "references": ["Cosine-Similarity-Metric-Learning-for-Face-Nguyen-Bai/472ba8dd4ec72b34e85e733bccebb115811fd726", "Labeled-Faces-in-the-Wild-%3A-A-Database-for-Studying-Huang-Mattar/370b5757a5379b15e30d619e4d3fb9e8e13f3256", "Face-Description-with-Local-Binary-Patterns%3A-to-Ahonen-Hadid/3607afdb204de9a5a9300ae98aa4635d9effcda2", "Enhanced-Local-Texture-Feature-Sets-for-Face-Under-Tan-Triggs/1d58d83ee4f57351b6f3624ac7e727c944c0eb8d", "Distance-measures-for-PCA-based-face-recognition-Perlibakas/a2ff11632d5116f0510800d84ae2943029f4fd33", "Enhanced-Patterns-of-Oriented-Edge-Magnitudes-for-Vu-Caplier/f834c50e249c9796eb7f03da7459b71205dc0737", "Beyond-simple-features%3A-A-large-scale-feature-to-Cox-Pinto/23ee7b7a9ca5948e81555aaf3a044cfec778f148", "Face-recognition-with-learning-based-descriptor-Cao-Yin/6043006467fb3fd1e9783928d8040ee1f1db1f3a", "How-far-can-you-get-with-a-modern-face-recognition-Pinto-DiCarlo/2643ef482e63eb56b9474fb7b37440764c8e2651", "Local-Gabor-Binary-Pattern-Whitened-PCA%3A-A-Novel-Nguyen-Bai/b9df25cc4be2f703b059da93823bad6e8e8c0659"]},

Fine"], "date": "1999", "abstract": "There have been several books written on Neural Networks from the engineering point of view. In recent years, some books have appeared on Neural Networks with statistical flavour. The present book is remarkable in the sense that it has a judicious mix of Statistics and Engineering literatures, especially with the incorporation of the concepts and results derived from Vapnik Chervonenkis(vc) dimension. As the author rightly pointed out, it is difficult to write a book at this juncture incorporating all the latest results related to Vapnik Chervonenkis(vc) theory. In this book, the author tried to provide theoretical analysis wherever possible. Additionally, at several places in the book, lengthy mathematical details are avoided and the respective references are adequately provided. Kolmogorov\u2019s theorem, its consequences in network design, and single hidden layer approximations are provided in Chapter 4 different from the architecture selection in Chapter 6. Chapter-wise exercises have been provided towards the end of the book. One major drawback of this book is the little importance given to real life applications. The author has indeed, at the end of Chapter 1, admitted this. Two or three completely worked out real life applications would have enhanced the credibility of this book. Appending a chapter on various statistical techniques used in feedforward networks would also have increased the utility of this book. The chapter may include topics such as (a) stochastic search techniques in feedforward neural networks and (b) convergence of multilayer perceptron to Bayes classifier and related issues. From the Series title, I think, one would expect the inclusion of the above stated material in the book. The book, otherwise, has been lucid, well written, easy to read and is a good text on feedforward networks.

In this work we provide a general group-theoretic framework for characterizing and understanding invariance in a family of hierarchical models. We show that by taking an algebraic perspective, one can provide a concise set of conditions which must be met to establish invariance, as well as a constructive prescription for meeting those conditions.

It is shown that a family of surfaces having d degrees of freedom has a natural separating capacity of 2d pattern vectors, thus extending and unifying results of Winder and others on the pattern-separating capacity of hyperplanes. Applying these ideas to the vertices of a binary n-cube yields bounds on the number of spherically, quadratically, and, in general, nonlinearly separable Boolean functions of n variables. It is shown that the set of all surfaces which separate a dichotomy of an infinite, random, separable set of pattern vectors can be characterized , on the average, by a subset of only 2d extreme pattern vectors. In addition, the problem of generalizing the classifications on a labeled set of pattern points to the classification of a new point is defined, and it is found that the probability of ambiguous generalization is large unless the number of training patterns exceeds the capacity of the set of separating surfaces.", "references": []},

It has been standard, however, to treat background and foreground modelling as separate processes \u2014 background subtraction is followed by blob detection and tracking \u2014 which prevents a principled computation of image likelihoods. This paper presents two theoretical advances which address this limitation and lead to a robust multiple-person tracking system suitable for single-camera real-time surveillance applications. The first innovation is a multi-blob likelihood function which assigns directly comparable likelihoods to hypotheses containing different numbers of objects. This likelihood function has a rigorous mathematical basis: it is adapted from the theory of Bayesian correlation, but uses the assumption of a static camera to create a more specific background model while retaining a unified approach to background and foreground modelling. Second we introduce a Bayesian filter for tracking multiple objects when the number of objects present is unknown and varies over time.

Local shape variability is accommodated by applying a vector-field transformation to the underlying material coordinate system of the template while constraining the transformation to be smooth (globally positive definite Jacobian). Smoothness is guaranteed without specifically penalizing large-magnitude deformations of small subvolumes by constraining the transformation on the basis of a Stokesian limit of the fluid-dynamical Navier-Stokes equations. This differs fundamentally from quadratic penalty methods, such as those based on linearized elasticity or thin-plate splines, in that stress restraining the motion relaxes over time allowing large-magnitude deformations. Kinematic nonlinearities are inherently necessary to maintain continuity of structures during large-magnitude deformations, and are included in all results. After initial global registration, final mappings are obtained by numerically solving a set of nonlinear partial differential equations associated with the constrained optimization problem.

Dubes"], "date": "1987", "abstract": "-This paper reports the results of a M ante Carlo study on the relative effectiveness of two internal indices in estimating the true number of clusters in multivariate data. The two indices are the Davies and Bouldin q~t index and a new modification of the Hubert F statistid \"t. Data in d dimensions are clustered to create sequences of partitions. Estimates are based on plots of the indices as functions of the number of recovered clusters. Neither index uses a-priori information. The effects of sample size, dimensionality, cluster spread, number of true clusters, and sampling window are examined. Clustered data are generated to assure a given number of distinct clusters. The degree of clustering in the data is verified by a separate Monte Carlo study based on the Jaccard and corrected Rand indices that exhibits the importance of correcting external indices for chance. The modified Hubert index, proposed here for the first time, is shown to perform better than the Davies-Bouldin index under all experimental conditions. Recovery of the true number of clusters gets better as the number of true clusters decreases and as the number of dimensions increases. No effect occurs due to sampling window. The complete link clustering method and a square error clustering method recognize the true number of clusters consistently better than the single link method. This study demonstrates the difficulty inherent in estimating the number of clusters. Cluster Cluster analysis Cluster validity Internal Index External index Stopping rule Monte Carlo analysis I. I N T R O D U C T I O N One of the most venerable problems in cluster analysis is: How many clusters are in the data? 3\"'j This question can be attacked from many sides and is especially important when validating the results of a cluster analysis. This paper describes some Monte Carlo experiments on estimating the number of clusters using the Davies-Bouldin index and a newly proposed index. Monte Carlo studies are the only effective means for comparing practical indices of clustering and objectively assessing the effects of parameters such as dimensionality, number of patterns, sampling window, and number and spread of clusters. Milligan I~ provides an excellent survey of Monte Carlo studies in cluster validation. Monte Carlo analysis is an accepted technique for comparing clustering methods. ~6'7) This paper considers clustering problems in which data appear as points in a metric space. Each object to be clustered is represented by a \"pattern\", or a d-dimensional feature vector. The measure of proximity between patterns is euclidean distance. The goal is to define a test for the number of clusters based only on the locations of the patterns and the results of a clustering algorithm. Three meaningful ways of asking the question: \"How many clusters are best.'?\" are reviewed below. The first statement of the question addressed in this paper is: Do the data contain the number of clusters I expect? This implies that the objects to be clustered have a-priori labels, such as category labels, and one is investigating whether the cluster labels assigned by a clustering method are consistent with the category labels. An external index of agreement, such as the Rand fs) index, is appropriate for ascertaining whether the data justify the number of a-priori clusters. Milligan et el. 191 and Hubert and Arabie I1\u00b0I provide reviews of such indices. This paper uses external indices only to verify the data for Monte Carlo experiments. A second statement of: \"How many clusters are bestT' is to ask whether it is \"unusual\" to achieve a value of an internal index as large (or as small) as the one obtained. An internal index of partitional adequacy compares the given proximity matrix with the partition of the objects obtained from a cluster analysis without reference to category labels or other a-priori information. Chasing an internal index of clustering is a subtle and difficult exercise. For example, one might cluster the data with a K-means algorithm and compute the square error, defined in Appendix A. A Monte Carlo analysis could develop a baseline distribution of square error appropriate for the problem if a suitable d I d r _ _ . k . , ~ _ . . . . . . . . . . . . ~ ' I _ L I S ~ 1 ~ ~ : 646 RJcH^RO C. DUBF..S one might generate \"'random\" data of various sorts, cluster the data to obtain the number of clusters of interest, and record the square error of the solution. Repeating this for a number of random data sets generates a type of baseline distribution for square error. However, random data constitute a\"straw man\" hypothesis since data with any number of clusters should exhibit a smaller square error than random data. For example, imposing a clustering solution with 6 clusters on data containing 4 true clusters will produce a smaller square error that imposing a 6-duster solution on random data. One cannot compare the square error for a 6-cluster solution to the distribution of square error for random data and conclude that the 6-cluster solution is \"correct\" or that the data contain 6 clusters. A second difficulty with using indices such as square error for internal criteria is that they depend heavily on problem parameters. Square error is a naturally decreasing function of the number of clusters and an increasing function of the numbers of patterns and dimensions. A major difficulty in selecting a population of patterns to which a solution can be compared is the difficult choice of sampling window. Should a hypercube or hypersphere with uniform data be used or would a Gaussian mixture be more appropriate? Should the data be normalized? How can model parameters be set? These considerations make one wonder whether a completely fair baseline distribution can ever be obtained for an internal index that will be appropriate for real data. Milligan m~ examines several internal indices of partitional adequacy and provides a comprehensive comparative study on thirty of them. Milligan's primary measure of an index's performance is its correlation with an external index of validity. Thus, although this study provides an excellent comparison, it evaluates no decision rules for actually using the indices to judge the goodness of a partition. Milligan and Cooper ~4~ do provide decision rules in the context of determining the appropriate level for cutting a dendrogram. Several of their indices were taken from Hubert and Levid j21 and are based on the point serial correlation between the given proximity matrix and a measure of recovered structure. Hubert and Schultz ~2~ propose a number of statistics that could serve as internal indices, most of which are descendents of Mantel's \"31 statistic for measuring space-time clustering. A third way of asking: \"How many clusters are best.'?\" is to apply a hierarchical, non-overlapping clustering algorithm and seek the \"best\" level for cutting the resulting dendrogram. A procedure for cutting a dendrogram is called a stoppin 0 rule. Stopping rules that depend on the change in a criterion from one hierarchy level to the next are called \"difference scores\". Cutting the dendrogram at any level partitions the data and the number of clusters depends on the cutting level. Asking where to cut the quantitative evaluation e r a single partition because a sequence of values for an index is available. Milligan and Coope r~4~ provide an excellent comparative review of 30 stopping rules. Duda and Hart\"% Wolfe Its~ and others \"~'17~ have used difference scores to ask ira cluster should be split, which is not the same as asking how many clusters are best. Everitfm'presented a Monte Carlo study of likelihood ratio tests and concluded that asymptotic results appear,,to be valid only when the ratio between the number of patterns and the number of features is at least 10. Beck ug~ reviewed such tests, sometimes called \"gap\" tests, and derived asymptotic distributions for some tests under both null hypotheses and alternative hypotheses. Practical applications of Bock's distributions have not yet been demonstrated. This paper attacks the problem in which a sequence of dusterings is available and one is asked to choose a stopping rule for the most appropriate number of clusters. The internal index being sought has meaning only in relation to other values of the index computed for the same data set. Theoretical analysis of stopping rules is very difficult and has only limited application. It appears that Monte Carlo studies, such as the one reported here, provide the only guide s to assessing the relative merits of stopping rules.", "references": ["Monte-Carlo-comparison-of-six-hierarchical-methods-Jain-Indrayan/523b993ee8473c7972419805a81fc4e2279b6f16", "The-Effect-of-Cluster-Size%2C-Dimensionality%2C-and-the-Milligan-Soon/6b1de953b0ebe4abf9fb3b9e8856e4b99d9e1561", "A-Monte-Carlo-Investigation-Of-The-Likelihood-Ratio-Everitt/b8118626fb2468c501aabc185588fa86c06aa073", "Validity-studies-in-clustering-methodologies-Dubes-Jain/0879ad520df851780fe290e9687fd4df1c27c4b4"]},

This, we believe, gives a strong indication that these problems are hard. Our reduction, however, is quantum.

The new cryptosystem is much more efficient than previous lattice-based cryptosystems: the public key is of size \u00d5(n2) and encrypting a message increases its size by a factor of \u00d5(n) (in previous cryptosystems these values are \u00d5(n4) and \u00d5(n2), respectively). In fact, under the assumption that all parties share a random bit string of length \u00d5(n2), the size of the public key can be reduced to \u00d5(n).", "references": ["Almost-perfect-lattices%2C-the-covering-radius-and-to-Micciancio/dd268a962f1857841921ff158846c93d9db8bc89", "Cryptographic-Hardness-for-Learning-Intersections-Klivans-Sherstov/859ce0ddbbf512940b932ec25465b3fbae3534c7", "Generating-Hard-Instances-of-Lattice-Problems-Ajtai/f6dbdf621b0acc9a131f7f2a4d3efbd4bfb0db58", "Factoring-Polynomials-with-Rational-Coefficients-Lenstra-Lenstra/2fa8b58bb107f8cdfdec4e4365befb2dcccab018", "Approximating-Shortest-Lattice-Vectors-is-not-than-Goldreich-Micciancio/6d14f86bbee6dbec5e1473d55f87273252f0ec1e"]},

Although the crosscorrelation itself (or some function of it) has sometimes been treated as a probability distribution, this is not generally jus tifiable. Bayesian correlation achieves a consistent probabilistic treatment by combining several developments. The first is the interpretation of correlation matching functions in probabilistic terms, as observation likelihoods. Second, probability distributions of filter-bank responses are learned from training examples.

Bayesian modeling is a powerful, practical, and general framework for meeting these requirements. This article develops a Bayesian model for describing and manipulating the dense fields, such as depth maps, associated with low-level computer vision. Our model consists of three components: a prior model, a sensor model, and a posterior model. The prior model captures a priori information about the structure of the field. We construct this model using the smoothness constraints from regularization to define a Markov Random Field. The sensor model describes the behavior and noise characteristics of our measurement system. We develop a number of sensor models for both sparse and dense measurements. The posterior model combines the information from the prior and sensor models using Bayes' rule. We show how to compute optimal estimates from the posterior model and also how to compute the uncertainty (variance) in these estimates. To demonstrate the utility of our Bayesian framework, we present three examples of its application to real vision problems. The first application is the on-line extraction of depth from motion. Using a two-dimensional generalization of the Kalman filter, we develop an incremental algorithm that provides a dense on-line estimate of depth whose accuracy improves over time. In the second application, we use a Bayesian model to determine observer motion from sparse depth (range) measurements. In the third application, we use the Bayesian interpretation of regularization to choose the optimal smoothing parameter for interpolation. The uncertainty modeling techniques that we develop, and the utility of these techniques in various applications, support our claim that Bayesian modeling is a powerful and practical framework for low-level vision.", "references": ["The-Computation-of-Visible-Surface-Representations-Terzopoulos/85d6afc4cfbeba292626ed1867daa447b48309e5", "Computational-vision-and-regularization-theory-Poggio-Torre/4c6bd3b8d35c4fc14360160efc9c66727abac9df", "Stochastic-Relaxation%2C-Gibbs-Distributions%2C-and-the-Geman-Geman/2408a19a13fcd4f76b2fe0b5d654fe5c276e6f0e", "A-computational-framework-and-an-algorithm-for-the-Anandan/eca65cc62a3fcc02f4cfce9761c2c4857ad2f262", "Stochastic-stereo-matching-over-scale-Barnard/e9af96dccc4d9745353df0a5ff4fc4f943e46bfe", "Optical-Flow-from-Spatiotemporal-Filters-Heeger/19fcaabf509ee577c84c5e49f6ee0d2fedf05668", "Image-Analysis-Using-Multigrid-Relaxation-Methods-Terzopoulos/28c3dbd8324dac29046249331035280d528744bc", "Regularization-of-Inverse-Visual-Problems-Involving-Terzopoulos/23844026bf30e29e2edf6f00dd1f167260d4db1e", "Probabilistic-solution-of-inverse-problems-Marroqu%C3%ADn/ba32816d67d864aa2df4722044b5c58ada88a3bd"]},

Along these lines, a number of studies have attempted to train unsupervised learning algorithms on natural images in the hope of developing receptive fields with similar properties13\u201318, but none has succeeded in producing a full set that spans the image space and contains all three of the above properties. Here we investigate the proposal8,12 that a coding strategy that maximizes sparseness is sufficient to account for these properties. We show that a learning algorithm that attempts to find sparse linear codes for natural scenes will develop a complete family of localized, oriented, bandpass receptive fields, similar to those found in the primary visual cortex. The resulting sparse image code provides a more efficient representation for later stages of processing because it possesses a higher degree of statistical independence among its outputs.", "references": []},

When I first began to study computer vision about ten years ago, I read parts of this book but did not really understand his insight. However, as I worked in the field, every time I felt I saw what was going on in a broader perspective or saw sonic theme which seemed to pull together the field as a whole, it turned out that this theme was part of what Grenander called pattern theory. It seems to me now that this is the right framework for these areas, and, as these fields have been growing explosively, the time is ripe for making an attempt to reexamine recent progress and try to make the ideas behind this unification better known.

A proof that Poly itself is valid under perspective as well as orthographic projection although its derivation in terms of gradient space is not, further indicates that gradient (or dual) space is not the important element in Mackworth's approach. Other ways of using dual space by Kanade and Huffman are discussed but they do not convincingly rebut the conclusion that dual space is peripheral to the design of a competent program.

More broadly, active vision encompassesattention, selective sensing in space, resolution, and time, whether it is achieved by modifying physical camera parameters or the way data is processed after leaving the camera. In the active-vision paradigm, the basic components of the visual system are visual behaviors tightly integrated with the actions they support; these behaviors may not require elaborate categorical representations of the 3-D world. Because the cost of generating and updating a complete, detailed model of most environments is too high, this approach to vision is vital for achieving robust, real-time perception in the real world. In addition, active control of imaging parameters has been shown to simplify scene interpretation by eliminating the ambiguity present in single images. Important research areas in active vision include attention, foveal sensing, gaze control, eye-hand coordination, and integration with robot architectures.", "references": []},

There is an alternate approach where the texture surface is transformed as a 2-D image until it conforms to a projection of a polygon placed arbitrarily in 3-space. The great advantage of this approach is that the 2-D transformation can be decomposed into two simple transforms, one in horizontal and the other in vertical scanline order. horizontal scanline order, Sophisticated light calculation is also time consuming and difficult to calculate correctly on projected polygons. Instead of calculating the lighting based on the position of the polygon, lights, and eye, the lights and eye can be transformed to a corresponding position for a unit square which we can consider to be a canonical polygon.

In this application, artificial neural networks are found to be superior to several previous techniques due in part to their ability to incorporate both spectral and contextual information.

Efficiency comes from processing the scene only where necessary, to the level of detail necessary, and with only the necessary operators. Knowledge representation and sequential decision making are central issues for selective vision, which takes advantage of prior knowledge of a domain's abstract and geometrical structure (e.g., \u201cpart-of\u201d and \u201cadjacent\u201d relationships), and also uses information from a scene instance gathered during analysis. The TEA-1 selective vision system uses Bayes nets for representation, benefit-cost analysis for control of visual and nonvisual actions; and its data structures and decision-making algorithms provide a general, reusable framework. TEA-1 solves the T-world problem, an abstraction of a large set of scene domains and tasks. Some factors that affect the success of selective perception are analyzed by using TEA-1 to solve ensembles of randomly produced, simulated T-world problems. Experimental results with a real-world T-world problem, dinner table scenes, are also presented.", "references": ["probabilistic-reasoning-in-intelligent-systems%3A-of-Pearl/7783fd2984ac139194d21c10bd83b4c9764826a3", "Using-intermediate-objects-to-improve-the-of-visual-Wixson-Ballard/3734ee041ded88046a3da4bfe513aaf445e73d19", "An-Introduction-to-Algorithms-for-Inference-in-Nets-Henrion/5b67c4d70499f2a4efe83874b17efd23bdaee337", "Verification-Vision-for-Programmable-Assembly-Bolles/f4cd6af20068bb50d6936280069dec469d55fcf4", "Bayesian-Networks-without-Tears-Charniak/21652af17e6e85c9c7a0846f3e483d00810838fd", "Fusion%2C-Propagation%2C-and-Structuring-in-Belief-Pearl/bafbca5d6d365726d5b67ccc673a28274fc91b37"]},

In the past, stereo algorithms have had problems at occlusions and have tended to fail there (though sometimes post-processing has been added to mitigate the worst effects). We show that, on the contrary, occlusions can help stereo computation by providing cues for depth discontinuities. We describe a theory for stereo based on the Bayesian approach, using adaptive windows and a prior weak smoothness constraint, which incorporates occlusion. Our model assumes that a disparity discontinuity, along the epipolar line, in one eyealways corresponds to an occluded region in the other eye thus, leading to anocclusion constraint. This constraint restricts the space of possible disparity values, thereby simplifying the computations. An estimation of the disparity at occluded features is also discussed in light of psychophysical experiments. Using dynamic programming we can find the optimal solution to our system and the experimental results are good and support the assumptions made by the model.", "references": ["A-Stereo-Matching-Algorithm-with-an-Adaptive-Theory-Kanade-Okutomi/d792816c732c8b5592becb2538b76ad71bd7cc8a", "A-Bayesian-treatment-of-the-stereo-correspondence-Belhumeur-Mumford/969c59dd4386affd4282924a9f2a90b058561eb7", "Da-vinci-stereopsis%3A-Depth-and-subjective-occluding-Nakayama-Shimojo/1d461a2a0aa46ee50d6ba95e3c35d4ee8f49137d", "Direct-Evidence-for-Occlusion-in-Stereo-and-Motion-Little-Gillett/5ad564ffc2743ee47324e1789cf300829d254ecf", "Stereo-Integration%2C-Mean-Field-Theory-and-Yuille-Geiger/b41691ea020ce930c832f2b52fe5a5db09733aa5", "Perception-of-multiple-transparent-planes-in-stereo-Weinshall/fc83bd1daa24a08b83f6d5197d783a6e99d0350c", "Toward-a-Model-Based-Bayesian-Theory-for-Estimating-Cernuschi-Fr%C3%ADas-Cooper/98d22b631060dbed1b40a0032fd1369c8c8fa45d"]},

The first part of the paper deals with the task of fusing and propagating the impacts of new information through the networks in such a way that, when equilibrium is reached, each proposition will be assigned a measure of belief consistent with the axioms of probability theory. It is shown that if the network is singly connected (e.g. tree-structured), then probabilities can be updated by local propagation in an isomorphic network of parallel and autonomous processors and that the impact of new information can be imparted to all propositions in time proportional to the longest path in the network.

Introduction Verification vision is a type of visual information processing that uses a model of a scene to locate objects of interest in a picture of the scene. The characteristics that distinguish verification vision (abbreviated VV) from the other types of visual information processing are: (1) the system has a great deal of prior knowledge about the type, placement, and appearance of the objects that form the scene and (2) the goal is to verify and refine the location of one or more objects in the scene. The following situation illustrates a typical use of VV: During the assembly of a pump, a mechanical arm places the pump base 1n a vise. The next step 1s to insert an aligning pin into one of the screw holes 1n the base. But the locat ion of the screw hole is not known precisely enough to insert the p1n d i rec t ly . The programmable assembly program needs to improve its estimate for the location of the hole. W 1s one way to accomplish th is subtask. In this task the pump base may be mispositioned to the extent of perhaps plus or minus half an inch and rotated pius or minus fifteen degrees, but there will not be any big surprises: the base will not be upside down or at the other end of the workstation. VV is designed to use this predictability to minimize the cost of reducing the uncertainties associated with the location of an object. It bridges the gap between the known tolerances on an object and the desired tolerances when the initial tolerances greatly restrict the possible appearance of the object. If the locations and appearances of the objects are greatly restricted, why not use any of several correlation operators to match corresponding features and use the positions of these matches to deduce the location of the screw hole? If the constraints on the objects guarantee unique matches for all of the features, this procedure may be acceptable. However, there are two main reasons why it is difficult to guarantee unique matches: (1) Constraints, even quite tight constraints, often do not guarantee a single match. For example, if a visual operator is designed to locate a certain corner, often there are other corners that are near the desired corner and look almost identical to it. Sometimes the operator may locate one of these decoys instead of the desired corner. The desired feature and the decoy features will be jointly referred to as known alternatives for the operator. (2) Visual operators, such as correlation operators, are not completely reliable; they do not always locate one of the known alternatives. Low level operators are notorious for occasionally locating something completely unexpected. This type of match will be referred to as a surprise. Thus, almost any interesting class of VV tasks includes situations in which the visual operators do not locate unique features. The VV system has to decide which known alternative or surprise has been matched by each operator. In VV there are several sources of information that can be used to help make these decisions. For example, the system may have previous pictures of the scene and constraints on the locations of the objects. The previous pictures can be used to predict the range of values produced by an operator and the constraints can be used to determine the portion of the picture in which a feature might appear. There are also sources of information that can be used to simplify the programming of VV tasks. For example, previous pictures of the scene or models of the objects in the scene can be used to suggest potentially useful features to be located. This paper describes a VV system that has been designed to take advantage of these diverse sources of knowledge. The second and fourth sections outline a structure for a VV system that makes it easier for programmers who are not experts in computer vision to program VV feedback. The third section presents a set of combination rules that are capable of combining the results of several different types of operators into the confidences and precisions that are required within VV. * The author is now at Stanford Research Institute, 535 Ravens wood, Menlo Park, Ca. 94025.

Government. V f s f o n 1 : B o l l e s 569 A V Vsystem based upon these ideas has been implemented and interfaced to the AL control system for mechanical arms [Finkel 1976]. The VV system helps the user select potentially useful operator/feature pairs, provides a training session to gather statistics on the behavior of the operators, automatically ranks the operator/feature pairs, and performs the task. The fifth section briefly describes the results of using this system. There are a few excellent, special-purpose systems that perform VV tasks (e.g., see [Baird 1976] and [Kashioka 1976]). There are also a few systems that handle a subclass of VV tasks (e.g., see [Fischler 1971], [Agin 1973], [Chien 1975] and [Holland 1975]), but none of these programs deal with the wide variety of available information or concentrate on the combination of precision and confidence to the extent required by the general class of VV tasks. The motivation for this research came mainly from the domain of programmable assembly. Some of the techniques have been optimized to take advantage of specific properties of this environment, but the basic methods are more widely applicable. Other possible applications include aerial photograph interpretation and medical image processing. A Structure for VV This section briefly describes the basic philosophy of a VV system and introduces some of the terminology. It characterizes the subtasks that are involved in setting up and performing VV tasks. Later sections will describe specific techniques that can be used to perform some of these subtasks. A V V system can be (somewhat arbitrarily) partitioned into four stages: (1) PROGRAMMING TIME: the user states the goal of the task, calibrates the camera, and chooses potential operator/feature pairs. (2) TRAINING TIME: if previous pictures of the scene are available, the system applies the operators to several sample pictures and gathers statistical information about their effectiveness. (3) PLANNING TIME: the system ranks the operators according to their expected contribution, determines the expected number of operators to be needed, and predicts the cost of accomplishing the task. (4) EXECUTION TIME: the system applies operators one at a time, combines the results into confidences and precision, and stops when the desired levels have been reached or a cost limit has been exceeded. These stages represent different conceptual steps in the development of a VV program. Different types of knowledge and techniques are applicable at different stages. To accomplish a VV task requires progress from one stage to the next in the order shown above. However, for clarity, the execution time will be discussed first. If one ignores the intermediate details, the VV process can be roughly characterized as follows: the programmer states the goal of the task in terms of the following three quantities. (a) the confidence that the system has found the correct object(s), (b) the precision within which the system has located the object(s), and (c) the cost involved in determining this information; and the system, at execution time, tries to extract useful information from a picture and combine the results of these extractions into estimates of the quantities of interest. The implementation of the VV system discussed in this paper gathers information by applying operators, such as edge operators, correlation operators, and region growers, that are designed to locate and describe features, such as line segments, correlation points, and regions.

We consider a method for increasing efficiency by searching only those subregions that are especially likely to contain the object. These subregions are identified via spatial relationships. Searches that use this method repeatedly find an \u201cintermediate\u201d object that commonly participates in a spatial relationship with the target object, and then look for the target in the restricted region specified by this relationship. Intuitively, such searches, calledindirect searches, seem likely to provide efficiency increases when the intermediate objects can be recognized at low resolutions and hence can be found with little extra overhead, and when they significantly restrict the area that must be searched for the target. But what is the magnitude of this increase, and upon what other factors does efficiency depend? Although the idea of exploiting spatial relationships has been used in vision systems before, few have quantitatively examined these questions. We present a mathematical model of search efficiency that identifies the factors affecting efficiency and can be used to predict their effects. The model predicts that, in typical situations, indirect search provides up to an 8-fold increase in efficiency. Besides being useful as an analysis tool, the model is also suitable for use in an online system for selecting intermediate objects.", "references": ["The-MVP-sensor-planning-system-for-robotic-vision-Tarabanis-Tsai/924ff2ce4097d5d088396709b7f13d906d48c6bf", "Control-of-selective-perception-using-bayes-nets-Rimey-Brown/e117889774d1d1fa3f20526db5ccb8e0a770f3f9", "Gaussian-error-models-for-object-recognition-Sarachik-Grimson/68effd87537181b42195d195187507fcef9c5920", "Occlusions-as-a-Guide-for-Planning-the-Next-View-Maver-Bajcsy/01db820cbbbf763f34ea424f604f2a3ced8cb366", "Active-object-recognition-Wilkes-Tsotsos/b93868e30bac3eaf547d01a934295a3206dce7bb", "Exploiting-World-Structure-to-Eeciently-Search-for-Wixson/f60e4082256608884b1d7b3d4721ca37a5638138", "Low-resolution-cues-for-guiding-saccadic-eye-Swain-Kahn/964276f299aaceb95c8a2ea08eabfb8d89ad0e7e", "Principles-of-animate-vision-Ballard-Brown/71756bb48fe56883d0fb18d5754a7457f13dd2cc"]},

A surface of interest here is modeled as a 3-D function known up to the values of a few parameters. Although the approach will work with any parameterization, we model objects as patches of spheres, cylinders, planes, and general quadrics-primitive objects. Primitive surface estimation is treated as the general problem of maximum likelihood parameter estimation of the a priori unknown primitive surface parameters based on two or more functionally related data sets. In our case, these data sets constitute two or more images taken by cameras at different locations and orientations. A simple geometric explanation is given for the estimation algorithm. Although various techniques can be used to implement this nonlinear estimation, we discuss the use of gradient descent. Experiments a re run and discussed. Our approach includes the commonly used stereo approaches as special cases. The CramerRao lower bounds are derived for the achievable error covariance matrices for estimators for the a priori unknown parameters. No surface reconstruction can be more accurate than these bounds. The dependence of the bounds on object surface pattern and on the camera and object geometry is shown explicitly. An interesting result arising in this work is that maximum-likelihood estimation of 3-D surfaces also requires maximum likelihood estimation of the pattern on the object surface. Object surface segmentation into primitive object surfaces, and primitive object-type recognition a re readily implemented using the probabilistic framework developed in this paper. The attractiveness of our probabilistic formulation is that it now permits a fully Bayesian approach to 3-D surface estimation based on images taken by cameras in two or more positions. For example, recent follow-on papers include estimation of parameterized surfaces based on a large number of images taken by a moving camera [ll], [27], estimation of stochastic surfaces based on images taken by cameras in two or more positions [3], and estimation of object surfaces given contour models for the patterns on the surface [28].

The techniques introduced permit controlled decomposition of a large problem into small problems for separate parallel processing where maximum likelihood estimation or Bayesian estimation or recognition can be realized locally. These results can be combined to arrive at globally optimum estimation or recognition. The approach is applied to the maximum likelihood estimation of 3-D complex-object position. To this end, the surface of an object is modeled as a collection of patches of primitive quadrics, i.e., planar, cylindrical, and spherical patches, possibly augmented by boundary segments. The primitive surface-patch models are specified by geometric parameters, reflecting location, orientation, and dimension information. The object-position estimation is based on sets of range data points, each set associated with an object primitive. Probability density functions are introduced that model the generation of range measurement points. This entails the formulation of a noise mechanism in three-space accounting for inaccuracies in the 3-D measurements and possibly for inaccuracies in the 3-D modeling. We develop the necessary techniques for optimal local parameter estimation and primitive boundary or surface type recognition for each small patch of data, and then optimal combining of these inaccurate locally derived parameter estimates in order to arrive at roughly globally optimum object-position estimation.", "references": ["Bayesian-Recognition-of-Local-3-D-Shape-by-Image-Bolle-Cooper/fdbd7514fdba9eaffb2223f2026444b4823d7b13", "Model-based-recognition-and-localization-from-data-Grimson-Lozano-P%C3%A9rez/221e269474bd0dc08f0a3f3d652b75a04d1ddfee", "Object-Recognition-Using-Three-Dimensional-Oshima-Shirai/cf575f36027ae74c628d6251d6453bc7c590b45e", "When-should-a-learning-machine-ask-for-help-Cooper/28361f6a63feb6ebfa572aa02e94e60966655c30", "Pattern-classification-and-scene-analysis-Duda-Hart/b07ce649d6f6eb636872527104b0209d3edc8188"]},

The proposed approach relies on a change in perspective: instead of seeking a heuristic directly for a given problem PI, one seeks instead a rolp___21gm P2 easier to solve than PI and related to PI in a certain way. The next step is to find an algorithm for finding paths in P2, then apply this algorithm in a certain way as a heuristic for P1. In general, the approach is to consider as candidates problems P2 that are \"edge subgraphs\" or \"edge supergraphs\" of the given problem Pl. As a non-trivial application, we show that a certain restricted form of sorting problem (serving as P2) is an edge supergraph of the 8-puzzle graph (P1). A simple algorithm for solving this sorting problem is evident, and the number of swaps executed in solving an instance thereof is taken as a heuristic estimate of distance between corresponding points in the 8-puzzle graph. Using the As algorithm, we experimentally compare the performance of this \"maxsort\" heuristic for the 8-puzzle with others in the literature. Hence we present evidence of a role for exploiting certain similarities among Problems to transfer a heuristic from one problem to another, from an \"easier\" problem to a \"harder\" one.", "references": ["Exactly-How-Good-Are-Heuristics%3A-Toward-a-Realistic-Gaschnig/447c71af3c3b4f9cbfe7abe051e76297d37d2892", "On-the-Optimality-of-A*-Gelperin/2c1dc0c2e08a842fd8b837942e2fb47ed8fb7f9f", "Problem-representations-and-formal-properties-of-Vanderbrug/76102aa4383a68b25146edbdeeb770c691522ed0", "Theoretical-comparisons-of-search-strategies-in-Ibaraki/c5cb7aac496b6acc6d57c7a762f8f4f6384f4623", "Heuristic-Search-Viewed-as-Path-Finding-in-a-Graph-Pohl/bba5a510c44fe6679249d9a939cbc0bc4ba9f658", "A-Formal-Basis-for-the-Heuristic-Determination-of-Hart-Nilsson/d46a3efd1b85c11cc9376fc8b48388eae5221d2b"]},

Two experiments, which elicited slips of the tongue under controlled conditions, revealed that repeated sounds in a speech plan are contributory causes of phoneme exchanges, anticipations, and perseverations. In addition, it was found that repeated sounds induce the misordering of sounds that are not adjacent to the repeated ones, as well as those that are adjacent to the repeated ones. An analysis of a collection of natural slips also supported the conclusion that repeated sounds cause nonadjacent sounds to slip.

A systematic specification and utilization of the available constraints could significantly reduce the amount of search in picture recognition. On the other hand, formally stated constraints can be embedded in the syntactic productions of picture languages. Only binary constraints are treated here, but they are represented in full generality as binary relations. Constraints among more than two variables are then represented as networks of simultaneous binary relations. In general, more than one equivalent (i.e., representing the same constraint) network can be found: a minimal equivalent network is shown to exist, and its computation is shown to solve most practical problems about constraint handling. No exact solution for this central problem was found. Anyway, constraints are treated algebtaically, and the solution of a system of linear equations in this algebra provides an approximation of the minimal network. This solution is then proved exact in special cases, e.g., for tree-like and series parallel networks and for classes of relations for which a distributive property holds. This latter condition is satisfied in cases of practical interest.

Bes ides, the c o n s t r a i n t o f the p o s i t i o n , the arrangement and the shape of the ob jec t s are necessary f o r the measurement of their 3-dimensional positions and sizes. In order to measure the 3-dimensional position direct ly, a range finder has been studied, and two typical methods have been developed up to now. One is to project a spot l ight and detect i ts (5) reflecting l ight , and the other is based on the stereoscopic view. The former takes a long time to got the range of many points of objects because it requires the rotation of a spot beam for the measurement of each point. The latter requires a great deal of calculation to determine the corresponding points of the two pictures. The method presented here employs a vert ical s l i t projector and a TV camera to pick up i ts reflected l ight . By rotating a projector from the le f t to the right, the distance of many points in a f ield of view is obtained quickly. 2. Construction of a range finder The range finder employed in this study projects a l ight beam through a vertical s l i t in a projector at a constant distance from a TV camera as shown in F ig . l . While the projector is rotated, pictures are sampled by a TV camera at predetermined instances and the information related to each picture and a corresponding s l i t beam angle is stored. If each position of a s l i t in the picture is determined from a stored picture, then i ts 3-dimensional position can be calculated by means of trigonometry. The input of picture data is controlled by a computer as shown in Fig.2, and the video signal of each picturee is converted into (7) a digi tal signal by a preprocessor. This preprocessor divides the frame of a camera into 256 x 256 picture elements, Session No. 3 Scene Analysis II General Papers 81 and 64 x 64 elements are sampled in one scanning time. 3. Recocrmtion of polyhedrons The recognition procedure of polyhedrons based on a set of picture data and s l i t beam angles involves ( l ) determination of s l i t positions, (2) composition of lines, (3) composition of planes , (4) determination of the position of planes, and (5) composition of polyhedrons. In ( l ) (3), only picture data are used; in (4), the 3-dimensional position of the plane is obtained with s l i t beam angles. In (5), the objects are recognized based on the interrelation of planes. There is an alternative process of estimating the distance to the surface for each point and then analyzing the two dimensional f ield of distance to find surface. This method takes a long time for calculation of the distance for evely point. The process presented here calculates only the end points of lines to determine the psoition of planes. Each procedure is described in detail in the fo i l owing. (1) Determination of s l i t positions Each picture corresponding to a s l i t beam angle is stored in binary form where each picture element is 1 if the l ight intensity is above the threshold, and 0 otherwise. At f i r s t this picture is smoothed to eliminate the effect of noise caused by a vidicon camera or a preprocessor. Let the binary picture element be denoted by the mutrix element C( i , j ) , the output of smoothing operation C ' ( i , j ) is the majority of C ( i , j ) , C(i, j l ) and C( i , j+ l ) . By examining elements C ' ( i , j ) along the j th row, from among the sequences whose element successively takes value 1, the longest sequence is selected, and i ts position is established as the center of the sequence. This operation is carried out for every j, and then a s l i t position is denoted by the sequence of points I ( j ) . Fig.4 i l lustrates the sequence of points for each s l i t position of a picture. (2) Composition of lines If polyhedrons are placed in the background that consists of planes, a projected s l i t image is generally composed of lines as shown in Fig.5. In the image, a discontinuous terminal point of a line corresponds to a discontinuous boundary point of a plane and an intersection of two lines corresponds to a boundary point of two adjacent planes. In the f i r s t step for composition of lines from the sequence of s l i t points I ( j ) , discontinuous points are found and each set of l ( j ) whose elements are regarded as continuous is l is ted. A set of s l i t points {T(j), J=J s~ Je} constitutes a line or several adjacent lines. The next step is , therefore, to find the number of lines included in a set of s l i t points, and the terminal points and the equation of each l ine. At f i r s t a sequence of I ( j ) which constitutes a line segment is found. This sequence {I ( j i ) , J i=J_ 3 ,J_ 2 , j_ 1J o , J-1' J2' J3} must satisfy the following two equations: 82 Session No. 3 Scene Analysis II General Papers line is found. This algorithm is , as shown in Fig.6, to track the s l i t point, sequentially correcting the equation of a l ine. Fig.7 shows the result of the tracking and Fig.8 shows the lines thus obtai ned. (3) Composition of planes This operation groups linos obtained in (2) into classes whose element constitutes a plane. If s l i t images are sampled at constant time intervals, then the images of the sl i ts projected on the same plane form nearly parallel lines at constant intervals. Adjacent lines which correspond to s l i t beam angles are grouped into the same class, and then the lines in a class are again d i vided into different classes based on their intervals. After this operation, each class of lines constitutes a plane. The principle of the above two classif i cation algorithms is about the same as that of tracking in (2); i .e. , at f i rs t find the segment of a plane and then examine the next line if it belongs to the plane unti l the boundary line of the plane is found. (4) Determination of the positions of planes A class of lines obtained in (3) does not precisely compose a plane because of errors in various phases of the procedure. In this stage, the 3-dimensional position of each plane is calculated from the class of lines and their corresponding s l i t beam angles. Let a plane consist of n lines and the equation of the plane be denoted by bx + c = 0. Let L(x., b, c) denote the Euclidian distance between the plane and a point x. on the i th l ine, then L(x i , b, c) can be easily calculated. Let the integral of L (x., b, c) be defined as (3) The coefficients of the equation of the plane, b and c, are determined by the least squares method so that the following value J is minimized.", "references": []},

Ballard"], "date": "1981", "abstract": "The use of curves to represent two-dimensional structures is an important part of many scientific investigations. For example, geographers use curves extensively to represent map features such as contour lines, roads, and rivers. Circuit layout designers use curves to specify the wiring between circuits. Because of the very large amount of data involved and the need to perform operations on this data efficiently, the representation of such curves is a crucial issue. A hierarchical representation consisting of binary trees with a special datum at each node is described. This datum is called a strip and the tree that contains such data is called a strip tree. Lower levels in the tree correspond to finer resolution representations of the curve. The strip tree structure is a direct consequence of using a special method for digitizing lines and retaining all intermediate steps. This gives several desirable properties. For curves that are well-behaved, intersection and point-membership (for closed curves) calculations can be solved in 0(log n) where n is the number of points describing the curve. The curves can be efficiently encoded and displayed at various resolutions. The representation is closed under intersection and union and these operations can be carried out at different resolutions. All these properties depend on the hierarchical tree structure which allows primitive operations to be performed at the lowest possible resolution with great computational time savings.\nStrip trees is a linear interpolation scheme which realizes an important space savings by not representing all the points explicitly. This means that even when the overhead of the tree indexing is added, the storage requirement is comparable to raster representations which do represent most of the points explicitly.", "references": []},

The proposed recognition method using UVD functions is as follows. 1) Given the a priori information about the contours of objects to be grasped, the UVD's of their contours are calculated and memorized. These are called the original patterns (OP's). 2) Then a sampled UVD is formed from real tactile data and called the data pattern (DP). 3) The DP is compared with the memorized patterns (MP's), which are obtained by blurring the corresponding OP, so as to make it easier to single out the best fitted OP. 4) Finally, the contour is regenerated in the hand coordinate system by using the UVD of the singled out pattern.

A typical task performed by our present system requires the robot vehicle to rearrange (by pushing) simple objects in its environment. A novel feature of our approach is the use of a formal theorem-proving system to plan the execution of high-level functions as a sequence of other, perhaps lower level, functions.

The assumption, unchallenged for many years, that PSG's were inadequate for natural languages is based on arguments originally advanced by transformational linguists in the late 1950\u00bbs and early 1960's. but recent work has shown that none of those arguments were valid. The present paper draws on that work to argue that (i) there is no reason, at the present time, to think that natural languages are not context-free languages, (ii) there are good reasons to think that the notations needed to capture significant syntactic generalizations will characterize phrase structure grammars or some minor generalization of them, and (iii) there are good reasons for believing that such grammars, and the monostratal representations they induce, provide the necessary basis for the semantic interpretation of natural languages. If these arguments are valid, then the prospects for a fruitful interaction between theoretical linguistics and AI are much brighter than they would otherwise be. I INTRODUCTION Consider the following quotations: As already mentioned, a context-free phrase structure grammar is not sufficient to describe or analyze the whole range of syntactic constructions which occur in natural language texts (cf. Chomsky 1957). Even if one disregards the theoretical linguist's demand for satisfactory descriptions of the syntactic structure of sentences, there are strong reasons to design a more powerful parser than the one described above. Cases in point are the phenomenon of agreement within noun phrases, the correspondence in the verb phrase between the form of the main verb and the type of the auxiliary, and subject verb agreement. The argument structure of predicates, that is, their various types of objects and complements, represents another kind of context-sensitivity in natural language. ... The best strategy seems to be to take care of the particular types of context-sensitivity recognized by linguistic theory by means of special procedures which act as a superstructure of the algorithm for context-free analysis. ... In addition to the above-mentioned drawbacks a context-free phrase structure grammar has difficulty handling word order variation in a natural way. One significant-use of the general context-free methods is as part \u2026", "references": []},

Chien", "R. Yen", "N. Bridwell"], "date": "1980", "abstract": "Two methods for detecting intersections among three dimensional objects are described. The first method involves detecting overlap among the projections of the objects on a given set of planes. The second method uses a three dimensional octree representation of the objects. Intersections are detected by traversing the trees for the obstacles and the moving objects. Application of the methods to collision avoidance is discussed. I INTRODUCTION An important problem in the robotics manipulation of its environment is that of following collision free trajectories when objects have to be moved. A representation or model of the spatial configuration of objects is necessary to obtain safe solutions, i.e. those which avoid collisions. In addition, a capability?0 plan an efficient trajectory, say, one following the shortest available path between the starting and the goal configurations , is desirable. In either case, a procedure is required to decide if an arbitrary configuration involves occupancy of a given region of space by multiple objects. The problem of interference detection usually involves static objects whereas collision detection refers to a situation where at least one object is in motion. Collision detection may be viewed as a sequence of intersection checks among appropriately defined static objects, and at appropriate time intervals. Thus the basic problem appears to be that of detecting intersection among a set of objects. Given a configuration of objects, it is not hard to develop an algorithm to check any intersections among the objects. However, in a reasonably complex environment and for reasonable speeds of object manipulation, e.g. translation, rotation, etc., the availability of a limited computational power may demand efficient procedures. At the heart of the design of such procedures lies the need for a good representation of the objects. Algorithms must be developed that take advantage of the properties of chosen representation to efficiently track the dynamic environment. solid in terms of a set of relatively simpler, planar patches used to approximate its surface. For the case of convex objects, Comba [21 obtains a pseudo-characteristic functioninterms of expressions for the planar patches. The function assumes nonpositive values in regions that approximate the parts of the space where all the objects intersect. Maruyama 151 compares the minimal boxes containing the objects. Boyse 111 considers three different types of objects: solids, surfaces and containers. Intersections are detected by checking if an edge of one object intersects a face of another.

The ability to derive an answer that is not stored explicitly, but that is derivable by the use of moderate effort from the stored facts. 4.

Section 6 summarizes the key ideas in the solution and indicates areas for future work. 2. AN EXAMPLE This section describes an example (Figure 2.1) of the collision detection and avoidance problem for a two-dimensional manipulator. The example highlights features of the problem and its solution. 2.1 The Problem The manipulator has two links and three degrees of freedom. The larger link, called the boom, slides back and forth and can rotate about the origin. The smaller link, called the forearm, has a rotational degree of freedom about the tip of the boom. The tip of the forearm is called the hand. S and G are the initial and final configurations of the manipulator. Any real manipulator's links will have physical dimensions. The line segment representation of the link is an abstraction; the physical dimensions can be accounted for and how this is done is described later. The problem of planning safe trajectories for computer controlled manipulators with two movable links and multiple degrees of freedom is analyzed, and a solution to the problem is presented. The trajectory planning system is initialized with a description of the part of the environment that the manipulator is to maneuver in. When given the goal position and orientation of the hand, the system plans a complete trajectory that will safely maneuver the manipulator into the goal configuration. The executive system in charge of operating the hardware uses this trajectory to physically move the manipulator. \u2026", "references": ["Design-of-a-computer-controlled-manipulator-for-Dobrotin-Scheinman/a011f5c232675569b1ec44516d1abff8338e5102"]},

This paper slso contains some methods and applications of effective use of color information in picture processing. They include (1) domain identification by color information (2) color effect method (3) color separation (4) conversational re-touching of color (5) pseudo-color displaying and their applications. 1. Introduction Picture processing by computer has been of considerable interest in computer science and robotics research. Most efforts in picture processing have been concerned with monochromatic pictures* But, as everyone realizes, actual scenes and pictures all contain color, and color information plays important roles in human perception and recognition of scenes and pictures. This suggests the usefulness of color information in picture processing by computer. In Ito(1973) we have discussed some basic problems and a conceptual framework for color picture processing by computer. We stated there the need of an experimental computer system for color picture processing and emphasized the importance of \"com-puter-oriented chromatics\". This paper contains an overall description", "references": []},

Experimental results that verify these equations are given. Adaptive data smoothing and normalization procedures are presented. These procedures reduce photon noise and correct the intensity data for inverse square-law effects. The resulting intensity data give the product of the diffuse surface reflectance and the cosine of the angle of incidence for each picture element in the scene. Simple procedures are given for finding outlines of occluding objects, obtaining normal views of obliquely sensed planar surfaces, and extracting the images of horizontal surface regions from a scene.

Stereo p i c t u r e processing and l i g h t i n t e r s e c t i n g methods are described along w i t h the r e s u l t of a new hardware system. On the example of a software system some special problems w i t h the a b s t r a c t i o n of scenes w i t h p r i m i t i v e obj e c t s are mentioned. A short look ahead to the f u t u r e closes t h i s paper. 1 I n t r o d u c t i o n When designing a robot system, we have t o deal w i t h the problem of how the robot can get informat i o n about i t s environment. To get f u l l i n formation it seems to be necessary to design a v i s u a l input f a c i l i t y . Therefore there is the problem of how the automaton can get a three dimensional image of the world from v i s u a l i n f o r m a t i o n . This paper describes some systems, designed in the past, and t r i e s to p o i n t out t h e i r problems and d i f f i c u l t i e s . S t a r t i n g from these considerations, a new system i s presented w i t h which some of the w e l l known d i f f i c u l t i e s may be overcome. 2. Stereo p i c t u r e s For i n t e r p r e t a t i o n of stereo p i c t u r e s the system needs two p i c t u r e s of the same scene, taken from d i f f e r e n t viewing angles ( f i g . 1). Provided t h a t the two camera p o s i t i o n s P1 and P2 and the angles a and B are known, the three dimensional c o o r d i nates of the p o i n t B of the scene can be c a l c u l a ted. The main problem in stereo p i c t u r e processing i s t o d e f i n e two conjugate p o i n t s i n the stereo p a i r . A f t e r the d e f i n i t i o n o f one point i n the f i r s t p i c t u r e , the corresponding p o i n t i n the second p i c t u r e must be located. This can only be done i f the p i c t u r e p o i n t contains s i g n i f i c a n t i n formation, e.g. a corner p o i n t . This means t h a t we have t o deal w i t h two d i f f e r e n t problems: f i r s t , we have t o d e f i n e a s i g n i f i c a n t p o i n t i n a f i r s t p i c t u r e , and second, we have to recognize the corresponding p o i n t i n the second p i c t u r e . I n order t o solve the f i r s t problem we have t o apply timeconsuming preprocessing methods l i k e edge enhancement, e t c . The second problem can be solved by two dimensional l o c a l c o r r e l a t i o n methods f\\/. Because o f these d i f f i c u l t i e s , stereo methods are not used in f u l l y automatic systems since now. 3. L i g h t i n t e r s e c t i n g methods I n a l l methods described below, i l l u m i n a t i o n o f the scene is regarded as a p a r t of the recognizing system. Then a l l v i s i b l e p o i n t s o f a scene f i t w i t h a s t r a i g h t l i n e of l i g h t or w i t h an i l l u m i n a t i n g plane o f l i g h t . With t h i s information the three d i mensional coordinates o f a l l v i s i b l e p o i n t s can b e c a l c u l a t e d from t h e i r two dimensional coordinates i n the p i c t u r e . Using t h i s p r i n c i p a l several systems were designed. 3.1 Laser range f i n d e r The laser range f i n d i n g system uses a plane of l i g h t w i t h known o r i e n t a t i o n i n space f o r i l l u m i n a t i o n of the scene. The plane of l i g h t is generated w i t h a laser and a c y l i n d r i c a l lens. In such an i l l u m i n a t e d scene the camera is able to see only the i n t e r s e c t i n g l i n e of the l i g h t plane and the surface of the scene. The camera takes a comp l e t e p i c t u r e o f t h i s image and transmits i t t o the computer f o r f u r t h e r processing and e x t r a c t i o n of three dimensional coordinates of the i n t e r s e c t i n g l i n e . By moving the l i g h t source step by step across th whole scene, the process of t r a n s m i t t i n g p i c t u r e s and c a l c u l a t i n g s p a t i a l coordinates i s r e peated. I t i s evident t h a t there i s a large amount of data being t r a n s m i t t e d and processed, one p i c tu r e per l i n e , containing very l i t t l e i n f o r m a t i o n . Therefore the system is i n t o l e r a b l y timeconsuming, Agin and B i n f o r d /5/ need about 5 to 10 minutes per scene. 3.2 P a r a l l e l g r i d i l l u m i n a t i o n In order to get quick r e s u l t s from the system, one must t r y to take the complete information of the scene w i t h only one p i c t u r e , i . e . the scene has to be i l l u m i n a t e d w i t h a l l planes of l i g h t a t the same time. The simplest way to do t h i s is to use an opt i c a l g r i d , being projected cnto the scene.

The performance is compared with that of a classical microwave receiver, i.e., one designed to optimize detection in a Gaussian channel. Such a receiver has the advantages of availability, simplicity, ease of implementation, and greater tolerance to slow photodetector response and is an obvious candidate for suboptimum detection. Procedures for calculating receiver performance in the Poisson regime by the tilted probability density technique are described and applied specifically to modulation schemes employing one or more subcarriers that are biphase or quadriphase modulated. Results indicate that the classical receiver falls noticeably short of the optimum only at or near 100 percent modulation, where it may require at worst up to 30 percent more light power in order to equal the maximum likelihood receiver. When modulation is incomplete, or when background radiation is significant, the difference in performance is generally much smaller.", "references": []},

Accordingly, an image is partitioned into small square windows, each of which is a view of a piece of a sphere, or of a cylinder, or of a plane. Windows are processed in parallel for recognition of content. New concepts and techniques include approximations of the image within a window by 2-D quadric polynomials where each approximation is constrained by one of the hypotheses that the 3-D surface shape seen is either planar, cylindrical, or spherical; a recognizer based upon these approximations to determine whether the object patch viewed is a piece of a sphere, or a piece of a cylinder, or a piece of a plane; lowpass filtering of the image by the approximation. The shape recognition is computationally simple, and for large windows is approximately Bayesian minimum-probability-of-error recognition. These classifications are useful for many purposes. One such purpose is to enable a following processor to use an appropriate estimator to estimate shape, and orientation and location parameters for the 3-D surface seen within a window.", "references": ["Multidimensional-Edge-Detection-by-Hypersurface-Morgenthaler-Rosenfeld/8b9abdac29dc47c2506d7af38c2af90880df7a75", "Calculating-the-reflectance-map.-Horn-Sjoberg/5a6946d8e2c8934c24faad2bb8f125534183bd96", "Image-segmentation-as-an-estimation-problem-Chen-Pavlidis/bc6b14455ac74594e07fd7b2c52fba86d3b6a738"]},

These include 3-D scene (outdoor and indoor) segmentation of a 2-D image, 3-D surface recognition and shape and position estimation from one or more images, and tracking of a moving camera from a sequence of images of fixed scenes. We take a model-based approach, wherein the image associated with a 3-D surface patch is locally approximated by either a homogeneous Markov Random Field (MRF) texture model which is specified by a few parameters having unknown values, or by parameterized contour curves having a few unknown parameters, or by other simply parameterized models. The least structured model we consider consists of the expectation at each pixel of a single image treated as a completely arbitrary a priori unknown parameter, thus modelling every possible image, but thereby requiring a huge number of parameters. We model ,3-D surfaces as functions described by a priori unknown parameters, ranging from a few to many. To provide a direct link between the image data and the 3-D surface that generates it, we relate the 3-D surface parameters, the camera geometry, the scene lighting, and the image model parameters. Because of this linking, 3-D shape recognition, location and orientation estimation, and scene segmentation is possible and can be easily formulated as optimal detection and estimation problems.", "references": ["Bayesian-Clustering-for-Unsupervised-Estimation-of-Silverman-Cooper/6fdbd5dc08c7d1a1b7a52a00a927cdcc2e5d942b", "Nonplanar-curve-and-surface-estimation-in-3-space-Taubin/7c4443dc20ac12d56c1d798141fae79800da70be", "On-Optimally-Combining-Pieces-of-Information%2C-with-Bolle-Cooper/19ff68829d0dabbdf29bb4a231f3815a76dcc80c", "Unsupervised-estimation-of-polynomial-to-smooth-in-Silverman-Cooper/24408c4251de6da201607d09817523d4065d27fc"]},

Our goal is to maximize the eeciency of such searches. The problem is analyzed using a simple mathematical description of the factors that aaect search eeciency. This analysis suggests that one way to improve eeciency is to take advantage of the spatial relationships in which the target object commonly participates. Searches that do so, which we call indirect searches, are modeled as two-stage processes that rst nd an intermediate object that commonly participates in a spatial relationship for the target object, and then look for the target in the restricted region speciied by this relationship. A mathematical model of search eeciency is then used to analyze the eeciency of indirect search over a wide range of situations that vary the spatial structure of the domain as well as recognition performance. The model predicts that, for searches that involve rotating a camera about a xed location, indirect searches improve eeciency by factors of 2 to 8. An implemented robot search system substantiates these predictions. Finally, we highlight some areas in need of further research if these eeciencies are to be achieved.", "references": ["Active-object-recognition-Wilkes-Tsotsos/b93868e30bac3eaf547d01a934295a3206dce7bb", "Task-specific-utility-in-a-general-Bayes-net-vision-Rimey-Brown/716ca4fe846974b532dad401d6d5578851e4bd2a", "Achieving-Generalized-Object-Recognition-through-of-Stark-Bowyer/4f0d8a0097a095f863caeb344b6a7448b9b99129", "Scaling-Reinforcement-Learning-Techniques-via-Wixson/ba207d24fd4ab329b419308acc74e7cc47945ea7", "Using-Active-Vision-to-Simplify-Perception-for-Reece-Shafer/aa1c2764d80e623d86935ea3853453d2901a11cd", "A-Fast-Line-Finder-for-Vision-Guided-Robot-Kahn-Kitchen/ceedf2ecc843fae6e9c58e812a245624990669c3"]},

Cooper"], "date": "1989", "abstract": "We introduce a graceful approach to probabilistic inference called bounded conditioning. Bounded conditioning monotonically refines the bounds on posterior probabilities in a belief network with computation, and converges on final probabilities of interest with the allocation of a complete resource fraction. The approach allows a reasoner to exchange arbitrary quantities of computational resource for incremental gains in inference quality. As such, bounded conditioning holds promise as a useful inference technique for reasoning under the general conditions of uncertain and varying reasoning resources. The algorithm solves a probabilistic bounding problem in complex belief networks by breaking the problem into a set of mutually exclusive, tractable subproblems and ordering their solution by the expected effect that each subproblem will have on the final answer. We introduce the algorithm, discuss its characterization, and present its performance on several belief networks, including a complex model for reasoning about problems in intensive-care medicine. 1 Toward Flexible Inference and Representations We have pursued the construction of representations and inference strategies that degrade gracefully, and in a well-characterized manner, as the amount of computation applied to reasoning is decreased. In general, the difficulty of a decision problem, the value of solving the problem, and the costs and availability of computation time may vary greatly. We desire inference strategies that are relatively insensitive to small changes in the amount of committed computation time. In particular, strategies that demonstrate (1) continuity and (2) monotonicity along a dimension of refinement, and that (3) converge on an optimal result in the limit of sufficient resources, are extremely valuable [7]. Such incremental-refinement approaches are of crucial importance for intelligent agents that depend on computation for decision making under the general condition of varying and uncertain resources because they allow for value to be extracted from incomplete solutions [7,5]. The strategies provide a continuum of object-level results that grant a system designer or a real-time metareasoner wide ranges over which to optimize the duration of reasoning before acting. The flexible strategies also allow us to squeeze the most inference out of a problem in situations where \u2217This work was supported by a NASA Fellowship under Grant NCC-220-51, by the National Science Foundation under Grant IRI-8703710, by the National Library of Medicine under Grant RO1LM0429, and by the U.S. Army Research Office Grant P-25514-EL.

To resolve the ambiguities that are caused by occlusions in images, we need to take sensor measurements from several different views. We have limited ourselves to range images obtained by a laser scanning system. It is an active system which can encounter two types of occlusions. An occlusion arises either when the reflected laser light does not reach the camera or when the direct laser light does not reach the scene surface. The task of 3-D data acquisition is divided into two subproblems: to acquire the depth information from one scanning plane and to select the proper scanning planes from which the direct laser light illuminates the entire scene. The first kind of occlusions (range shadows) are easily detected and can be used in designing an efficient algorithm. We develop a strategy to determine the sequence of different views using the information in a narrow zone around the occluded regions. Occluded regions are approximated by polygons. Based on the height information of the border of the occluded regions and geometry of the edges of the polygonal approximation, the next views in the same scanning plane the directions of the next scanning planes for further data acquisition are computed.

MVP automatically synthesizes desirable camera views of a scene based on geometric models of the environment, optical models of the vision sensors, and models of the task to be achieved. The generic task of feature detectability has been chosen since it is applicable to many robot-controlled vision systems. For such a task, features of interest in the environment are required to simultaneously be visible, inside the field of view, in focus, and magnified as required. In companion papers we analytically characterize the domain of admissible camera locations, orientations, and optical settings for which each of the above feature detectability requirements is satisfied separately. In this paper, we present a technique that poses the vision sensor planning problem in an optimization setting and determines viewpoints that satisfy all previous requirements simultaneously and with a margin. In addition, we present experimental results of this technique when applied to a robotic vision system that consists of a camera mounted on a robot manipulator in a hand-eye configuration. The camera is positioned and the lens is focused according to the results generated by MVP.

We start with the premise that having a map of your environment is generally a good thing if you need to move between specific places whose locations are clearly indicated on that map. The more frequent your need to move between locations, the more useful you will probably find a good map. If you are not supplied with a map and you find yourself spending an inordinate amount of time blundering about, it might occur to you to build one, but the amount of time you spend in building a map will probably depend upon how much you anticipate using it. Once you have decided to build a map, you will have to decide when and exactly how to go about building it. Suppose that you are on an errand to deliver a package and you know of two possible routes, one of which is guaranteed to take you to your destination and a second which is not. By trying the second route, you may learn something new about your environment that may turn out to be useful la.ter, but you may also delay the completion of your errand. Huey, the robot used in our experiments, is built almost entirely from off-the-shelf components: a 1%inch diameter synchro-drive base from Real World Interface (Dublin, New Hampshire), a sonar ring subsystem from Denning Mobile Robotics (Wilmington, Massachusetts) equipped with 8 Polaroid ultrasonic sensors, and an 80286-based IBM/AT compatible computer with 2M of memory, a 3-inch floppy, and a serial interface card, running the QNX operating system from Quantum Software (Kanata, Ontario). The various microprocessors on Huey communicate through serial lines. Huey can operate autonomously using on-board power and computing, or tethered to a Unix workstation. Huey\u2019s ultrasonic sensors provide it with information about the distance to nearby objects. With a little care, Huey can detect the presence of a variety of geometric features using these sensors. In gathering information about the office environment, Huey will drive up to a surface to be investigated, align one of the sensors to the right or to the left of its direction of travel along the surface, and then move parallel to that surface looking 1010 ROBOTICS From: AAAI-90 Proceedings.

The goal is to demonstrate that several problems previously associated with the approach can be attributed to the low dimensionality of invariants used. These include limited index selectivity, excessive accumulation of votes in the look-up table buckets, and excessive sensitivity to quantization parameters. Theoretical results demonstrate that using high-dimensional, highly descriptive global invariants produces better results in terms of accuracy, false positive suppression, and computation time. A practical example of high-dimensional global invariants is introduced and used to implement a 2-D shape acquisitionhecognition system. The acquisitiodrecognition system is based on a two-step table look-up mechanism. First, local curve descriptors are obtained by correlating image contour information at short range. Then, seven-dimensional global invariants are computed by correlating triplets of local curve descriptors at longer range. This experimental system is meant to illustrate the behavior of a high-dimensional indexing scheme. Indeed, its performance shows good agreement with the analytical model with respect to database size, fault tolerance, and recognition speed. Model acquisition time is linear to cubic in the number of object features. Object recognition time is constant to linear in the number of models in the database and linear to cubic in the number of features in the image. The system has been tested extensively, with more than 250 arbitrary shapes in the database.

Marr"], "date": "1969", "abstract": "1. A detailed theory of cerebellar cortex is proposed whose consequence is that the cerebellum learns to perform motor skills. Two forms of input-output relation are described, both consistent with the cortical theory. One is suitable for learning movements (actions), and the other for learning to maintain posture and balance (maintenance reflexes).2. It is known that the cells of the inferior olive and the cerebellar Purkinje cells have a special one-to-one relationship induced by the climbing fibre input. For learning actions, it is assumed that:(a) each olivary cell responds to a cerebral instruction for an elemental movement. Any action has a defining representation in terms of elemental movements, and this representation has a neural expression as a sequence of firing patterns in the inferior olive; and(b) in the correct state of the nervous system, a Purkinje cell can initiate the elemental movement to which its corresponding olivary cell responds.3. Whenever an olivary cell fires, it sends an impulse (via the climbing fibre input) to its corresponding Purkinje cell. This Purkinje cell is also exposed (via the mossy fibre input) to information about the context in which its olivary cell fired; and it is shown how, during rehearsal of an action, each Purkinje cell can learn to recognize such contexts. Later, when the action has been learnt, occurrence of the context alone is enough to fire the Purkinje cell, which then causes the next elemental movement. The action thus progresses as it did during rehearsal.4. It is shown that an interpretation of cerebellar cortex as a structure which allows each Purkinje cell to learn a number of contexts is consistent both with the distributions of the various types of cell, and with their known excitatory or inhibitory natures. It is demonstrated that the mossy fibre-granule cell arrangement provides the required pattern discrimination capability.5. The following predictions are made.(a) The synapses from parallel fibres to Purkinje cells are facilitated by the conjunction of presynaptic and climbing fibre (or post-synaptic) activity.(b) No other cerebellar synapses are modifiable.(c) Golgi cells are driven by the greater of the inputs from their upper and lower dendritic fields.6. For learning maintenance reflexes, 2(a) and 2(b) are replaced by2'. Each olivary cell is stimulated by one or more receptors, all of whose activities are usually reduced by the results of stimulating the corresponding Purkinje cell.7. It is shown that if (2') is satisfied, the circuit receptor --> olivary cell --> Purkinje cell --> effector may be regarded as a stabilizing reflex circuit which is activated by learned mossy fibre inputs. This type of reflex has been called a learned conditional reflex, and it is shown how such reflexes can solve problems of maintaining posture and balance.8. 5(a), and either (2) or (2') are essential to the theory: 5(b) and 5(c) are not absolutely essential, and parts of the theory could survive the disproof of either.", "references": ["Nerve-net-models-of-plausible-size-that-perform-Brindley/e79677c4ffd05c1402f8e82018b2898ed9cf2f03", "Quantitative-data-on-the-inferior-olivary-nucleus-Escobar-Sampedro/1bd14c16c8108db72f75078ac6e1f89a1569a7fe", "Responses-in-the-dorsal-accessory-olive-of-the-cat-Armstrong-Eccles/b3f7b984a240687c370e6333e6e485de4c20ab7c", "The-Cerebellum-as-a-Neuronal-Machine-Eccles-Ito/374a5b9237fe9effad56506be95a5973d899fb85", "A-pattern-recognition-program-that-generates%2C-and-Uhr-Vossler/07966d22c11df99cae6661587815f7b7e59698ae", "Descending-connections-to-the-inferior-olive%3B-an-in-Walberg/49e369a8fdd84aa2530d7a2cf9a434237a178e6e"]},

The interpretation of a text is the minimal explanation of why the text would be true.

Goldman"], "date": "1988", "abstract": "We propose that logic (enhanced to encode probability information) is a good way of characterizing semantic interpretation. In support of this we give a fragment of an axiomatization for word-sense disambiguation, nounphrase (and verb) reference, and case disambiguation. We describe an inference engine (Frail3) which actually takes this axiomatization and uses it to drive the semantic interpretation process. We claim three benefits from this scheme. First, the interface between semantic interpretation and pragmatics has always been problematic, since all of the above tasks in general require pragmatic inference. Now the interface is trivial, since both semantic interpretation and pragmatics use the same vocabulary and inference engine. The second benefit, related to the first, is that semantic guidance of syntax is a side effect of the interpretation. The third benefit is the elegance of the semantic interpretation theory. A few simple rules capture a remarkable diversity of semantic phenomena. I . I n t r o d u c t i o n The use of logic to codify natural language syntax is well known, and many current systems can parse directly off their axiomatizations (e.g.,)[l]. Many of these systems simultaneously construct an intermediate \"logical form\" using the same machinery. At the other end of language processing, logic is a well-known tool for expressing the pragmatic information needed for plan recognition and speech act recognition [2-4]. In between these extremes logic appears much less. There has been some movement in the direction of placing semantic interpretation on a more logical footing [5,6], but it is nothing like what has happened at the extremes of the ~anguage understanding process. To some degree this is understandable. These \"middle\" parts, such as word-sense disambiguation, noun phrase reference, case disambiguation, etc. are notoriously difficult, and poorly understood, at least compared to things like syntax, and the construction of intermediate logical form. Much of the reason these areas are l This work has been supported in part by the National Science Foundation under grants IST 8416034 and IST 8515005 and Office ~)f Nav~l Research under grant N00014-79-C-0529. so dark is that they are intimately bound up with pragmatic reasoning. The correct sense of a word depends on context, as does pronoun resolution, etc. Here we rectify this situation by presenting an axiomatization of fragment of semantic interpretation, notably including many aspects previously excluded: wordsense disambiguation, noun-phrase reference determination, case determination, and syntactic disambiguation. Furthermore we describe an inference engine, Frail3, which can use the logical formulation to carry out semantic interpretation. The description of Frail3 is brief, since the present paper is primarily concerned with semantic interpretation. For a more detailed description, see [7]. The work closest to what we present is that by Hobbs [5]; however, he handles only noun-phrase reference from the above list, and he does not consider intersentential influences at all. Our system, Wimp2 (which uses Frail3), is quite pretty in *,wo respects. First, it integrates semantic and pragmatic processing into a uniform whole, all done in the logic. Secondly, it provides an elegant and concise way to specify exactly what has to be done by a semantic interpreter. As we shall see, a system that is roughly comparable to other state-of-the-art semantic interpretation systems [6,8] can be written down in a pagc or so of logical rules. Wimp2 has been implemented and works on all of the examples in this paper. I I . V o c a b u l a r i e s 87 Let us start by giving an informal semantics for the special predicates and terms used by the system. Since we are doing semantic interpretation, we are translating between a syntactic tree on one hand and the logical, or internal, representation on the other. Thus.we distinguish three vocabularies: one for trees, one for the internal representation, and one to aid in the translation between the two. The vocabulary for syntactic trees assumes that each word in the sentence is represented as a word instance which is represented as a word with a numerical postfix (e.g., boy22). A word instance is associated with the actual lexical entry by the predicate word-inst: (word-inst word-instance part-ofospeech lexwal-item). For example, (word-inst case26 noun case). (We use \"part of speech\" to denote those syntactic categories that are directly above the terminal symbols in the grammars, that is, directly above words.) The relations between word instances are encoded with two predicates: syn-pos, and syn-pp. Syn-pos (syn-pos relation head sub-constituent), indicates that the sub-constituent is the relation of the head. We distinguish between positional relations and those indicated by prepositional phrases, which use the predicate syn-pp, but otherwise look the same. The propositions denoting syntactic relations are generated during the parse. The parser follows all possible parses in a breadth-first search and outputs propositions on a word-by-word basis. If there is more than one parse and they disagree on the propositional output, a disjunction of the outputs is a.~ert.ed into the database. The correspondence between trees and formulas is as follows: Trees s up (vp ... head-v ...) vp . . . . head-v np ... vp ~ ... head-v npl np2 ... vp . . . . head-v ... (pp prep ...) pp ~ prep np Formulas (syn-pos subject head-v np) head-v symbol is s symbol (syn-pos object head-v up) (syn-pos indirect-object head-v npl) (syn-pos object head-v npg) (syn-pp head-prep head-v prep) (-yn-pp prel>-np prep rip) np ... head-n ... head-n symbol is np symbol np pronoun pronoun symbol is np symbol np propernoun propernoun symbol is np symbol np . . . . adj head-n ... (syn-pos adj adj head-n) np . . . . head-n ... (pp prep ...) up that s s np (vp ... copula (pp prep ...)) s np (vp ... copula adj) (syn-pp head-prep head-n prep) s symbol is np symbol (syn-pp head-prep np prep) (syn-pos adj ad3 np) This is enough to express a wide variety of simple declarative sentences. Furthermore, since our current parser implements a transformational account of imperatives, questions (both yes-no and wh), complement constructions, and subordinate clauses, these are automatically handled by the above as well. For example, given an account of \"Jack wants to borrow the book.\" as derived from \"Jack wants (np that (s Jack borrow the book)).\" or something similar, then the above rules would produce the following for both (we also indicate after what word the formula is produced): 88 Words Jack wants", "references": ["Local-Pragmatics-Hobbs-Martin/15647bf9f1f0ecb6f56d036391090e734031c246", "TEAM%3A-An-Experiment-in-the-Design-of-Transportable-Grosz-Appelt/49d84aea1228ad029d809fc0700421aa4e1904a9", "A-Neat-Theory-of-Marker-Passing-Charniak/f7b27f149f4a946a7c04fb208c7d8dbf7fa8f34b", "An-Assumption-Based-TMS-Kleer/ed3f9263e936a879092ad7a2bf27e0f94089ccd8", "Generalized-Plan-Recognition-Kautz-Allen/adc713f0787f9fdef701d63615acd4aad61165a6", "Contexts-and-Data-Dependencies%3A-A-Synthesis-McDermott/94b86aef413b2fa7d952ecfd3eb4a4d156b2d4d6", "Definite-Clause-Grammars-for-Language-Analysis-A-of-Pereira-Warren/fbc04a1951003ba164303b2898fb7f3c6b4e9083", "Elements-of-a-Plan-Based-Theory-of-Speech-Acts-Cohen-Perrault/e649f0b186ca826f0ec2bdf2886507ee02d099e8"]},

In this theory, discourse structure is composed of three separate but interrelated components: the structure of the sequence of utterances (called the linguistic structure), a structure of purposes (called the intentional structure), and the state of focus of attention (called the attentional state). The linguistic structure consists of segments of the discourse into which the utterances naturally aggregate. The intentional structure captures the discourse-relevant purposes, expressed in each of the linguistic segments as well as relationships among them. The attentional state is an abstraction of the focus of attention of the participants as the discourse unfolds. The attentional state, being dynamic, records the objects, properties, and relations that are salient at each point of the discourse. The distinction among these components is essential to provide an adequate explanation of such discourse phenomena as cue phrases, referring expressions, and interruptions. The theory of attention, intention, and aggregation of utterances is illustrated in the paper with a number of example discourses. Various properties of discourse are described, and explanations for the behavior of cue phrases, referring expressions, and interruptions are explored. This theory provides a framework for describing the processing of utterances in a discourse. Discourse processing requires recognizing how the utterances of the discourse aggregate into segments, recognizing the intentions expressed in the discourse and the relationships among intentions, and tracking the discourse through the operation of the mechanisms associated with attentional state. This processing description specifies in these recognition tasks the role of information from the discourse and from the participants' knowledge of the domain.", "references": ["On-the-Recursive-Structure-of-Discourse-Polanyi-Scha/cf9c6650864023958d59fd3d63d5dc4043eedad4", "The-intonational-Structuring-of-Discourse-Hirschberg-Pierrehumbert/f2e90663c51f7be1505627b72f4f53bbaba70614", "Plan-parsing-for-intended-response-recognition-in-Sidner/cef304161e6cbfff317670b666ec3d523c9d0995", "Planning-English-Referring-Expressions-Appelt/b2101f9437be9fa995a7319eb87d7f6febbdd9b7", "Speech-Acts-and-Rationality-Cohen-Levesque/377e186570d22fe66b6381bf6b672a8691021eca", "A-Syntactic-Approach-To-Discourse-Semantics-Polanyi-Scha/d1f6f992ecf2948e8f944926299cd21858c39c52", "Extended-Person-Machine-Interface-Reichman-Adar/d875e2fd3616e46c761d2181b75ea0fa07ee0710"]},

Computational al effiCiency is a driving force. Perceptual networks are very deep, typically fifteen levels of structure. Images are very wide, e.g. an unspecified number of edges may appear anywhere in an image 512 x 512 or larger. For efficiency, we dynamically instantiate hypotheses of observed objects. The network is not fixed, it is only partially instantiated. Hypothesis generation and indexing are important, but they are not considered here [Nevatia 73}, [Ettinger 88}. This work is aimed at near-term implementation with parallel computation in a radar surveillance system, ADRIES [Levitt 88], (Franklin 88] and a system for industrial part recognition, SUCCESSOR [Bin\u00ad ford 88]. For many applications, VlBion must be !aster to be practical and so efficiently controlling the machine vision process is critical. Perceptual operators may scan megapixels and may require minutes of computation time. It is necessary to avoid unnecessary sensor actions and computa\u00ad tion. Parallel computation is available at several levels of processor capability. The potential for parallel, distributed computation for high-level vision means distributing non-homogeneous compu\u00ad tations. This paper addresses the problem of control in machine vision systems based on Bayesian probability models. We separate control and inference to extend the previous work [Binford 87] to maximize utility instead of probability. Maximizing utility allows adopting perceptual strategies for efficient information gathering with sensors and analysis of sensor data. Results of controlling machine vision via utility to recognize military situations are presented in this paper. Future work extends this to industrial part recognition for SUCCESSOR.", "references": []},

The problem is to be able to combine evidence from the lexicon, syntax, semantics, and pragmatics to arrive at the best of the many possible interpretations. Given the well-worn sentence \u201cThe box is in the pen,\u201d syntax may say that \u201cpen\u201d is a noun, while lexical knowledge may say that \u201cpen\u201d most often means writing implement, less often means a fenced enclosure, and very rarely means a female swan. Semantics may say that the object of \u201cin\u201d is often an enclosure, and pragmatics may say that the topic is hiding small boxes of illegal drugs inside aquatic birds. Thus there is evidence for multiple interpretations, and one needs some way to decide between them. In the past few years, some general approaches to interpretation have been advanced within an abduction framework. Charniak (1986) and Norvig (1987, 1989) are two examples. Abduction is a term coined by Pierce (1955) to describe the (unsound) inference rule that concludes A from the observation B and the rule A ) B, along with the fact that there is no \u201cbetter\u201d rule explaining B. In this paper we critically evaluate three recent abductive interpretation models, those of Charniak and Goldman (1989); Hobbs, Stickel, Martin and Edwards (1988); and Ng and Mooney (1990). These three models add the important property of commensurability: all types of evidence are represented in a common currency that can be compared and combined. While commensurability is a desirable property, and there is a clear need for a way to compare alternate explanations, it appears that a single scalar measure is not enough to account for all types of processing. We present other problems for the abductive approach, and some tentative solutions.", "references": ["Plan-Recognition-in-Stories-and-in-Life-Charniak-Goldman/9b6c027f89c8e83c680a0d3e9a78dc8e96447057", "A-Logic-for-Semantic-Interpretation-Charniak-Goldman/1d96dd3e1035b435f65e7b209cce3e1d7c379d83", "On-the-Role-of-Coherence-in-Abductive-Explanation-Ng-Mooney/34ac1b21784c6a2687b520ff3bf01e198c5ce84c", "A-Semantics-for-Probabilistic-Quantifier-Free-with-Charniak-Goldman/17c4097bbed82ea0873f082ce243f908cc0c4f50", "Marker-Passing-as-a-Weak-Method-for-Text-Norvig/71f6f2fb5fa836e99da7998bd9ea78fa2201a945", "Plan-recognition-in-stories-and-in-life%2C-Charniak-Goldman/e26643ff0212a4a4d81d1e50c1c5846be12a3b7b", "Interpretation-as-Abduction-Hobbs-Stickel/0b8849902fb39a71f3f2061e06b4d2e4e7f5dc3a", "Multiple-Simultaneous-Interpretations-of-Ambiguous-Norvig/842c2928de684c38c7a48fc3c5b2c57a79e72dc9"]},

Previously, autofocus schemes have used depth of field to measured depth by searching for the lens setting that gives the best focus, repeating this search separately for each image point. This search is unnecessary, for there is a smooth gradient of focus as a function of depth. By measuring the amount of defocus, therefore, we can estimate depth simultaneously at all points, using only one or two images. It is proved that this source of information can be used to make reliable depth maps of useful accuracy with relatively minimal computation. Experiments with realistic imagery show that measurement of these optical gradients can provide depth information roughly comparable to stereo disparity or motion parallax, while avoiding image-to-image matching problems.", "references": ["A-Perspective-on-Range-Finding-Techniques-for-Jarvis/ad7167bb0409986ca0ed1870cd3cc0ef7fb5b490", "Synthetic-Image-Generation-with-a-Lens-and-Aperture-Potmesil-Chakravarty/c6994e503c563af565022157b358357e6ddf6246", "A-theoretical-analysis-of-the-visual-accommodation-Crane/1040bf7423bae6b105882354668e44776eb6ad50"]},

This paper sketches the outline of a discourse grammar which acknowledges several different levels of structure. This gram~nar, the \"Dynamic Discourse Model\", uses an Augmented Transition Network parsing mechanism to build a representation of the semantics of a discourse in a stepwise fashion, from left to right, on the basis of the semantic representations of the individual clauses which constitute the discourse. The intermediate states of the parser model the intermediate states of the social situation which generates the discourse. The paper attempts to demonstrate that a discourse may indeed be viewed as constructed by means of sequencing and recursive nesting of discourse constituents. It gives rather detailed examples of discourse structures at various levels, and shows how these structures are described in the framework proposed here. \"I DISCOURSE STRUCTURES AT DIFFERE.NT LEVELS If a discourse understanding system is to be able to assemble the meaning of a complex discourse fragment (such as a story or an elaborate description) out of the meanings of the utterances constituting the fragment, it needs a correct structural analysis of it. Such an analysis is also necessary to assign a correct semantic interpretation to clauses as they occur in the discourse; this is seen most easily in cases where this interpretation depends on phenomena such as the discourse scope of temporal and locative adverbials, the movement of the reference time in a narrative, or the interpretation of discourse anaphora. The Dynamic Discourse Model, outlined in this paper, is a discourse grammar under development which analyses the structure of a discourse in order to be able to deal adequately with its semantic aspects. It should be emphasized at the outset that this system is a formal model of discourse syntax and semantics, but not a computer implementation of such a model. For a system to be able to understand a discourse, it must be able to analyse it at several different levels. i. Any piece of talk must be assigned to one Interaction -i.e., to a socially constructed verbal exchange which has, at any moment, a well-defined set of participants. 2. Virtually every interaction is viewed by its participants as belonging to a particular predefined genre -be it a doctor-patient interaction, a religious ceremony, or a casual chat. Depending on the genre, certain participants may have specific roles in the verbal exchange, and there may be a predefined agenda specifying consecutive parts of the interaction. An interaction which is socially \"interpreted\" in such a fashion is called a Speech Event (Hymes,1967,1972). 3. A stretch of talk within one Speech Event may be characterized as dealing with one Topic. 4. Within a Topic, we may find one or more Discourse Units (DU's) -socially acknowledged units of talk which have a recognizable \"point\" or purpose, while at the same time displaying a specific syntactic/semantic structure. Clear examples are stories, procedures, descriptions, and jokes. 5. When consecutive clauses are combined into one syntactic~semantic unit, we call this unit a discourse constituent unit (dcu). Examples are: lists, narrative structures, and various binary structures (\"A but B\", \"A because B\", etc.). 6. Adjacency Structures may well be viewed as a kind of dcu, but they deserve special mention. They are two or three part conversational routines involving speaker change. The clearest examples are question-answer pairs and exchanges of greetings. 7. The smallest units which we shall deal with at the discourse level are clauses and operators. Operators include \"connectors\" like \"and\", \"or\", \"because\", as well as \"discourse markers\" like \"well\", \"so\", \"incidentally\". The levels of discourse structure just discussed are hierarchically ordered. For instance, any DU must be part of a Speech Event, while it must be built up out of dcu's. The levels may thus be viewed as an expansion of the familiar linguistic hierarchy of phoneme, morpheme, word and clause. This does not mean, however, that every discourse is to be analysed in terms of a five level tree structure, with levels corresponding to dcu, DU, Topic, Speech Event and Interaction. To be able to describe discourse as it actually occurs, discourse constituents of various types must be allowed to be embedded in constituents of the same and other types. We shall see various examples of this in later sections. It is worth emphasizing here already that \"high level constituents\" may be embedded in \"low level constituents\".

A natural implementation of a \"cognitive map' might therefore consist of an assertional data base for topological in]brmation and a ' fuzzy map\" for the metric information. A fuzzy map captures facts about objects by recording their relative positions, orientations, and scales in convenient frames of reference. It is f)4zzy in the sense that coordinates are specified to lie in a range rather than having fixed values. The fuzzy map allows easy retrieval of information. The same information is also represented in a discrimination tree, which allows an object to be retrieved given its location and other attributes. The problem of constructing a fuzzy map is more difficult; we present a partial solution, an algorithm that assimilates a ]'act first by imposing constraints on the fuzzy coordinates of the objects involved, then by rearranging or growing the tree of frames of reference. Route planning is modelled as a process of finding the overall direction and topology of the path, then filling in the details by deciding how to go around barriers. It uses the retrieval algorithms. Our program SPAM carries out all these processes. 1. I n t r o d u c t i o n Imag ine yourse l f in this s i tua t ion: You are t rying to get into a park that is on the o the r side of a wall.

IWe use 'Cambridge Polish', that is, LISP notation, throughout. In this notation, the predicate or function in a formula or term comes first, accompanied by parentheses. So the proposition usually expressed as x y we write ( ,x v). This is the format accepted by our programs, and it has come to seem natural to us. P L A N N I N G R O U T E S T H R O U G H U N C E R T A I N T E R R I T O R Y 109 The propositional data base may be thought of as a semantic network or indexed set of assertions [5]. It consists of a straightforward predicate-calculus encoding of atomic (quantifier-free) facts, mainly regarding overlap and inclusion relationships. Assimilating a new fact into such a data base is, of course, very simple; the fact is just added. Unfortunately, there is more to space than topology. Many facts depend crucially on the metric character of the space we inhabit. The metric information should not be ignored; for instance, a route planner should do better if it makes use of the global direction in which it is going. 2 But metric constraints cannot be encoded straightforwardly as a set of propositions. Deductions about the values of constrained terms get expensive as the number of constraints grows [3]. We turn, therefore, to the fuzzy map as a storehouse of metric knowledge. In a fuzzy map, unlike a propositional data base, inference is easy and retrieval is hard. The idea is to store, not the facts, but a map in which the facts are true. By a map, we simply mean a table giving the relevant at tr ibutes--posi t ion, orientation, height, e tc . -of each object. The advantage of this is that inference is often a matter of 'just looking' at the map. If you want to know the distance between two points, you just apply the Pythagorean formula to their coordinates. The only problem with this approach is that a realistic set of symbolic facts will never constrain the map to any degree of precision. We accommodate this in two ways [18]: (1) We do not insist on storing an exact value for every attribute, but only a range, or \"fuzz'. (2) We allow many frames of reference. An object 's position or orientation may be known with great precision in one frame, and only vaguely in another. The second feature is just as important as the first, but the phrase fuzzy map is catchier than multiple-frame map, so we use the former. Whether fuzzy maps have anything to do with fuzzy logic [27] is left for the reader to judge. This modification complicates retrieval, but gives us some maneuvering room in assimilation. Retrieval must now take fuzz into account. This leads to the use of hill-climbing or Monte Carlo methods. The use of multiple frames means that the program must be able to transform quantities from one frame to another. ~ Objects are more than abstract frames of reference. They have shapes, masses, traversibilities. Our representation system allows extension to many such descriptors in a straightforward way. Numerical descriptors are represented as fuzzy quantities, constrained by facts known about the objects. Any descriptor not handled this way just becomes a predicate. 2Sec [10] for an at tempt to get by without much metric information. 3The transformation coefficients which relate two frames (their relative position, scale, and orientation) are themselves fuzzy quantities, of course. 1 l() 1). M C D E R M O T I \" A N D [-.. D A V I S The most important such case is shape description. We describe the shape~ of objects as prototypes plus modifications [15]. This description involves boIh topological knowledge and metric knowledge. There are three phase~ tt~ describing the shape of an object: (1) It must be given a generic .shape. For instance, we describe I-t()RSE(~I as a HORSE. Generic shapes are stored as propositions giving the parts of ~hc typical instance of this class, and the constraints among them.-* (2) Its parts, if an}, must be declared to be parts. The propositional data base might record that TAIL49 is the part of HORSE61 corresponding to the T A I L modification of the H O R S E shape. (3) Constraints on the relative sizes and angles of the parts must bc stored in the fuzzy map. The map might show that the length of TAIL40 is more than half the height of HORSE61. We talk about this in more detail in Sectiou 3. 1.1.2. Retrieving spatial (acts Retrievals from the assertional data base are done by TOPO, a set of special-purpose theorem-proving modules. For instance, that facl \"If A is IN B and /3 is IN ( \\ then A is IN (\"\" is used by the route planner to notice that the (\" must be exited if you are in /3 and c \" is a barrier enclosing /3. These routines are used in only a few cases, when we are confident that they will be efficient even if the data base is large. For instance, we would not use this fact to enumerate As given ('s. but only vice versa. Retrievals from the fuzzy map are done by a module called M E A S U R E .

The alternative is a \" weak method \" which is applicable to a variety of knowledge structures. Just such a method is proposed here. one which recognizes six very general classes of inference. These classes ore not dependent on individual knowledge structures, but instead rely on patterns of connectivity between concepts.

The reader of a text is faced with a formidable task: recognizing the individual words of the text, determining how they are structured into sentences, and deciding the explicit meaning of each sentence in the face of ambiguities. On top of that, the reader must also make inferences about the likely implicit meaning of each sentence, and the implicit connections between sentences. An inference is defined here to be any assertion which the reader comes to believe to be true as a result of reading the text, but which was not previously believed by the reader, and was not stated explicitly in the text. It is important to distinguish between inference and deduction. Inferences need not follow logically or necessarily from the text; the reader can jump to conclusions that seem likely but are not 100% certain. Conversely, there can be assertions which necessarily follow from a text (are deducible from the text), but which are not inferred.

New spatial reasoning techniques are described which are useful both for prediction within a vision system, and for planning within a manipulation system. We introduce new approaches to prediction and interpretation based on the propagation of symbolic constraints. Predictions are two pronged. First, prediction graphs provide a coarse filter for hypothesizing matches of objects to image feature. Second, they contain instructions on how to use measurements of image features to deduce three dimensional information about tentative object interpretations. Interpretation proceeds by merging local hypothesized matches, subject to consistent derived implications about the size, structure and spatial configuration of the hypothesized objects. Prediction, description and interpretation proceed concurrently from coarse object subpart and class interpretations of images, to fine distinctions among object subclasses and more precise three dimensional quantification of objects.

Schubert"], "date": "1984", "abstract": "It is argued that syntactic preference principles such as Right Association and Minimal Attachment are unsatisfactory as usually formulated. Among the difficulties are: (I) dependence on ill-specified or implausible principles of parser operation; (2) dependence on questionable assumptions about syntax; (3) lack Of provision, even in principle, for integration with semantic and pragmatic preference principles; and (4) apparent counterexamples, even when discounting (I)-(3). A possible approach to a solution is sketched. I. Some preference principles The following are some standard kinds of sentences illustrating the role of syntactic preferences. (I) John bought the book which I had selected for Mary (2) John promised to visit frequently (3) The girl in the chair with the spindly legs looks bored (4) John carried the groceries for Mary (5) She wanted the dress on that rack (6) The horse raced past the Darn fell (7) The boy got fat melted (I) (3) illustrate Right Association of PP's and adverbs, i.e., the preferred association of these modifiers with the rightmost verb (phrase) or noun (phrase) they can modify (Kimball 1973). Some variants of Right Association (also characterized as Late Closure or Low Attachment) which have Dean proposed are Final Arguments (Ford et al. 1982) and Shifting Preference (Shieber 1983); the former is roughly Late Closure restricted to the last obligatory constituent and any following optional constituents of verb phrases, while the latter is Late Closure within the context of an LR(1) shiftreduce parser. Regarding (4), it would seem that according to Right Association the PP for Mar~ should be preferred as postmodifier of groceries rather than carried; yet the opposite is the case. Frazier & Fodor's (1979) explanation is based on the assumed phrase structure rules VP -> V NP PP, and NP -> NP PP: attachment of the PP into the VP minimizes the resultant number of nodes. This principle of Minimal Attachment is assumed to take precedence over Right Association. Ford et al's (1982) variant is Invoked Attachment, and Shieber's (1983) variant is Maximal Reduction; roughly speaking, the former amounts to early closure of no___nn-final constituents, while the latter chooses the longest reduction among those possible reductions whose initial constituent is \"strongest\" (e.g., reducing V NP PP to VP is preferred to reducing NP PP to PP). In (5), Minimal Attachment would predict association of the PP on that rack with wanted, while the actual preference is for association with dress. Both Ford et al. and Shieber account for this fact by appeal to lexical preferences: for Ford et al., the strongest form of want takes an NP complement only, so that Final Arguments prevails; for Shieber, the NP the dress is stronger than wanted, viewed as a V requiring NP and PP complements, so that the shorter reduction prevails. sentence (6) leads most people \"down the garden path\", a fact explainable in terms of Minimal Attachment or its variants. The explanation also works for (7) (in the case of Ford et al. with appeal to the additional principle that re-analysis of complete phrases requiring re-categorization of lexical constituents is not possible). Purportedly, this is an advantage over Marcus' (1980) parsing model, whose three-phrase buffer should allow trouble-free parsing of (7). 2. Problems with the preference principles 2.1 Dependence on ill-specified or implausible principles of parser operation. Frazier & Fodor's (1979) model does not completely specify what structures are built as each new word is accommodated. Consequently it is hard to tell exactly what the effects Of their preference principles are. Shieber's (1983) shift-reduce parser is welldefined. However, it postulates complete phrases only, whereas human parsing appears to involve integration of completely analyzed phrases into larger, incomplete phrases. Consider for example the following sentence Deginnings: (8) So I says to the ... (9) The man reconciled herself to the ... (10) The news announced on the ... (11) The reporter announced on the ... (12) John beat a rather hasty and undignified ... People presented with complete, spoken sentences beginning like (8) and (9) are able to signal detection of the errors about two or three syllables after their occurrence.

Ballard"], "date": "1981", "abstract": "-The Hough transform is a method for \"~.~tecting curves by exploiting the duality between points on a curve and parameters of that curve. The initial work showed how to detect both analytic curves (1'2) and non-analytic curves, (3) but these methods were restricted to binary edge images. This work was generalized to the detection of some analytic curves in grey level images, specifically lines, 14) circles 15) and parabolas/6) The line detection case is the best known of these and has been ingeniously exploited in several applications/7'89) We show how the boundaries of an arbitrary non-analytic shape can be used to construct a mapping between image space and Hough transform space. Such a mapping can be exploited to detect instances of that particular shape in an image. Furthermore, variations in the shape such as rotations, scale changes or figureground reversals correspond to straightforward transformations of this mapping. However, the most remarkable property is that such mappings can be composed to build mappings for complex shapes from the mappings of simpler component shapes. This makes the generalized Hough transform a kind of universal transform which can be used to find arbitrarily complex shapes. Image processing Parallel algorithms Hough transform Shape recognition Pattern recognition 1. I N T R O D U C T I O N In an image, the pertinent information about an object is very often contained in the shape of its boundary. Some appreciation of the importance of these boundary shapes in human vision can be gained from experiments performed on the human visual system, which have shown that crude encodings of the boundaries are often sufficient for object recognition (1\u00b0) and that the image may be initially encoded as an 'edge image', i.e. an image of local intensity or color gradients. Marr (~ 1) has termed this edge image a 'primal sketch' and suggested that this may be a necessary first step in image processing. We describe a very general algorithm for detecting objects of a specified shape from an image that has been transformed into such an edge representation. In that representation, sample points in the image no longer contain grey level information, but instead each sample point contains a magnitude and direction representing the severity and orientation of the local grey level change. Operators that transform the image in such a way are known as edge operators, and many such operators are available, all based on different models of the local grey level changes. Two of the most used are the gradient operator (for example, see Prewitt ~12)) and the Hueckel operator/t3J which model local grey level changes as a ramp and a step respectively. * The research described in this report was supported in part by NIH Grant R23-HL-2153-01 and in part by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation Grant 78-4-15. Our generalized Hough algorithm uses edge information to define a mapping from the orientation of an edge point to a reference point of the shape. The reference point may be thought of as the origin of a local co-ordinate system for the shape. Then there is an easy way of computing a measure which rates how well points in the image are likely to be origins of the specified shape. Figure 1 shows a few graphic examples of the information used by the generalized Hough transform. Lines indicate gradient directions. A feature of the transform is that it will work even when the boundary is disconnected due to noise or occlusions. This is generally not true for other strategies which track edge segments.

This approach is based on the premise that knowledge of new situations is acquired and interpreted in terms of the previous knowledge brought to the learning situation.

This frame of reference is used to construct an interpretation for the patterns of human activity that are observed in games of baseball.Multiple levels of knowledge and processing are used to proceed through various levels of description of the observed human behavior. Hypothesis Generation shifts the pattern description from observed physical actions such as \"catch\" and \"run\" to inferred goals and causal relationships of the players executing those actions. Hypothesis Generalization abstracts generalized classes of events and schemata that represent concepts such as \"hit\" and \"out\". Hypothesis Evaluation closes the loop in the learning process by verifying or rejecting the various hypotheses. Knowledge encoded as schemata direct these processes; there are schemata for inferring competitive and cooperative goals and causal relationships of players.An important aspect of the system is its ability to use acquired knowledge. The multi-level organization facilitates the integration of the new information into the existing knowledge structure. Also, both the initial knowledge and the acquired knowledge are represented uniformly as schemata (production rules). Acquired schemata, then, are available to assist in interpreting and predicting future events. This ability demonstrates the effectiveness of our knowledge-directed approach to learning.", "references": []},

Lesser", "Lee D. Erman"], "date": "1977", "abstract": "The Hearsay model has heen presented as a paradigm for attacking errorful knowledge-intensive problems requiring multiple, cooperating knowledge sources. The Hearsay-II architecture is the latest attempt to explore the model. This paper describes experiences gained while successfully applying this architecture to the problem of speech understanding. The major conclusions are: 1. The paradigm of viewing problem solving in terms of hypothesize-and-test actions distributed among distinct representations of the problem has been shown to be computationally feasible. 2. A global working memory (the \"blackboard\"), in which the distinct representations are integrated in a uniform manner, has made it convenient to construct and integrate the individual sources of knowledge needed for the problem solution. 3. The use of a uniform data-directed structure for controlling knowledge-source activity has made the system easy to understand and modify. 4. A solution has been demonstrated to the problem of focusof-attention in this type of control environment. This solution does not need to be modified when the sources of knowledge in the system are changed. INTRODUCTION The Hearsay model [Red73Mo] has been developed for problem-solving in domains which must use large amounts of diverse, errorful, and incomplete knowledge in order to search in a large space. The Hearsay-1 architecture and system [Red73Hx and Erm74En] represented a first (and successful) attempt to apply that model to the problem of understanding connected speech in specialized task domains. In this first application, the size of the vocabulary (less than 100 words) and complexity of the grammar were very limited. Experiences with Hearsay-1 led to the more generalized Hearsay-II architecture [Les750r and Erm75Mu] in order to handle more difficult problems (e.g., larger vocabularies and lessconstrained grammars). The first configuration of knowledge sources (KSs) for Hearsay-II -configuration CI \u2014 was complete in January, 1976 [CMU76W4]. This implementation had poor performance (e.g., 107 sentences correct in 85 MIPSS (million instructions per second of speech) on a 250-word vocabulary). Experience with this configuration has led to a substantially different set of KSs \u2014 configuration C2 [CMU77Su]. This configuration performs substantially better (e.g., 857. correct in 60 MIPSS on a 1,000-word vocabulary). The Hearsay-II system, with the second configuration, has been successful: it comes close to the original performance goals set out in 1971 to be met by the end of 1976 for the ARPA speech understanding effort [New73Sp] and does so with a system organization that is of interest because of the potential for its application to other problem areas. Several other problems have been attacked with organizations strongly influenced by the 1 Author's current address: Department of Computer and Information Science, University of Mass., Amherst, Mass. 01003. 2 This work was supported by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (F44620-73-C-0074) and is monitored by the Air Force Office of Scientific Research. 3 Other approaches for solving this class of problem include production systems, frames [Min74Fr], heterarchical structures [Wal770v and Woo76Fi], relaxation techniques [Bar76MS and Ros76Sc), Planner [Hew72De], QA4 [Rul73Qa], and the Locus model [Low76Ha and Rub77Lo]. Hearsay-II structure: image understanding [Pra77Se], reading comprehension [Rum76To], protein-crystallographic analysis [Eng77Kn], signal understanding [Nii77Ru], and complex learning [Sol77Kn]. This paper is divided into two major parts. The first part presents an overview of the Hearsay model, the Hearsay-II architecture, which is a further specification of this model, and the two KS configurations. (More detailed descriptions of these configurations are contained in the appendix.) The second part of the paper discusses the implication of these experiences for the Hearsay model and the Hearsay-II architecture. In particular, those aspects of the architecture are identified that have contributed most strongly to the success of the system, as well as those parts that need the most future work.** This discussion is structured around two themes -the multi-level global data base (blackboard) for KS cooperation, and the asynchronous, data-directed control structure for KS activation. OVERVIEW OF THE HEARSAY MODEL A number of characteristics of the problem drive the Hearsay model: 1. Large search space. 2. Diverse sources of knowledge. Many of the KSs are large; some have large internal search problems of their own. 3. Error and variability. These are characteristics of both the input data (the acoustic signal) and the processing of knowledge sources. 4. Experimental approach needed for system development. This implies the need for iterating the system and running over large amounts of data. 5. Performance requirement -accuracy and speed. This is true of any practical solution to the problem as well as during development (because of the experimental nature). The basic notions of the Hearsay model [Red73Mo] were developed in response to the requirements just stated: 1. The KSs are kept separate, independent, and anonymous. This separation is felt to be a decomposition which is natural and also can help make the combinatoric problems more tractable. For development purposes, the separation should help with system modifications (especially adding and modifying KSs) and evaluation. 2. A global data structure -the blackboard -is the means of communication and interaction of KSs. This provides an hypothesize-and-test means of interaction. Each KS accesses and modifies the blackboard in a uniform way. 3. A KS responds to changes to the blackboard which it is concerned with; it applies its knowledge within the context' 4 The fact that certain parts of the implementation need further work does not necessarily indicate deficiencies with the basic Hearsay model, but rather points out inadequacies in the Hearsay-II implementation of the model. It is to the model's credit that even though some of its more sophisticated capabilities are not implemented effectively, it still provides an appropriate framework for the successful solution of a complex task. Thus, one of the intents of this paper is to define some of the major design goals for the next iteration in the implementation of the Hearsay model. 5 While this paper discusses the means of organizing the knowledge and applying it to the problem, it does not describe in detail nor quantify the knowledge in the system. At least as much work has been expended on specifying and debugging the knowledge in the system as on building and refining the structure to hold and apply that knowledge. Specialal ized Svstems-2: 790 Lesser of such a change. This implies data-directed activation of KSs.

Each grammar rule consists o f a syntactic part that specifies an acceptable fragment of a parse tree, and a semantic part that specifies how the logical formulas corresponding to the constituents of the fragment are to be combined to yield the formula for the fragment. However, we have sought to reformulate Gazdar's semantic rules so as to obtain more or less 'conventional' logical translations of English sentences, avoiding the interpretation of NPs as property sets and the use of intensional functors other than certain propositional operators. The reformulated semantic rules often turn out to be slightly simpler than Gazdar's. Moreover, by using a semantically ambiguous logical syntax for the preliminary translations, we can account for quantifier and coordinator scope ambiguities in syntactically unambiguous sentences without recourse to multiple semantic rules, and are able to separate the disambiguation process from the operation of the parser-translator.

Shieber"], "date": "1983", "abstract": "Native speakers of English show definite and consistent preferences for certain readings of syntactically ambiguous sentences. A user of a natural-language-processing system would naturally expect it to reflect the same preferences. Thus, such systems must model in some way the l inguistic per formance as well as the l inguistic competence of the native speaker. We have developed a parsing a lgor i thm--a variant of the LALR(I} shift.-reduce a lgor i thm-tha t models the preference behavior of native speakers for a range of syntactic preference phenomena reported in the psycholinguistic literature, including the recent data on lexical preferences. The algorithm yields the preferred parse deterministically, without building multiple parse trees and choosing among them. As a side effect, it displays appropriate behavior in processing the much discussed garden-path sentences. The parsing algorithm has been implemented and has confirmed the feasibility of our approach to the modeling of these phenomena. 1. I n t r o d u c t i o n For natural language processing systems to be useful, they must assign the same interpretation to a given sentence that a native speaker would, since t h a t is precisely the behavior users will expect.. Consider, for example, the case of ambiguous sentences. Native speakers of English show definite and consistent preferences for certain readings of syntactically ambiguous sentences [Kimball, 1973, Frazier and Fodor, 1978, Ford et aL, 1982]. A user of a natural-language-processing system would naturally expect, it to reflect the same preferences. Thus, such systems must model in some way the l ineuistie per formance as well as the linguistic competence of the native speaker. This idea is certainly not new in the artificial-intelligence literature. The pioneering work of Marcus [Marcus, 1980] is perhaps the best. known example of linguistic-performance modeling in AI. Starting from the hypothesis tha t ~deterministic\" parsing of English is possible, he demonstrated that certain performance \"This research was supported by the Defense Advanced Research Proiects Agency under Contract NOOO39-80-C-0575 with the Naval Electronic Systems Command. The views and conclusions contained in this document are those of the author and should not be interpreted a.s representative of the oh~cial policies, either expressed or implied, of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency or the United States government. constraints, e.g., the difl]culty of parsing garden-path sentences, could be modeled. His claim about deterministic parsing was quite strong. Not only was the behavior of the parser required to be deterministic, but, as Marcus claimed, The interpreter cannot use some general rule to take a nondeterministic grammar specification and impose arbitrary constraints to convert it to a deterministic specification {unless, of course, there is a general rule which will always lead to the correct decision in such a case). [Marcus, 1980, p.14] We have developed and implemented a parsing system that. given a nondeterministic grammar, forces disambiguation in just the manner Marcus rejected (i.e. t .hrough general rules}; it thereby exhibits the same preference behavior that psycbolinguists have at t r ibuted to native speakers of English for a certain range of ambiguities. These include structural ambiguities [Frazier and Fodor, 1978, Frazier and Fodor, 1980, Wanner, 1980l and lexical preferences [Ford et aL, 1982l, as well as the gardenpath sentences as a side effect. The parsing system is based on the shih.-reduee scheduling technique of Pereira [forthcoming]. Our parsing algorithm is a slight variant of LALR{ 1) parsing, and, as such, exhibits the three conditions postulated by Marcus for a deterministic mechanism: it is data-driven, reflects expectations, and has look-ahead. Like Marcus's parser, our parsing system is deterministic. Unlike Marcus's parser, the grammars used by our parser can be ambiguous. 2. T h e P h e n o m e n a to be M o d e l e d The parsing system was designed to manifest preferences among ,~tructurally distinct parses of ambiguous sentences. It, does this by building just one parse t ree ra ther than building multiple parse trees and choosing among them. Like the Marcus parsing system, ours does not do disambiguation requiring \"extensive semantic processing,\" hut, in contrast to Marcus, it does handle such phenomena as PP-at tachment insofar as there exist a priori preferences for one at tachment over another. By a priori we mean preferences tha t are exhibited in contexts where pragmatic or plausibility considerations do not tend to favor one reading over the other. Rather than make such value judgments ourselves, we defer to the psycholinguistic literature {specifically [Frazier and Fodor, 1978], [Frazier and Fodor, 1980] and [Ford et al., 1982]) for our examples.", "references": ["Is-the-human-sentence-parsing-mechanism-an-ATN-Fodor-Frazier/c8f5cd2f38c327788d37751f220d21c551ffbb85", "The-ATN-and-the-Sausage-Machine%3A-Which-One-is-Wanner/77bfb53b5dff30519fa9c3791a09424d2eb2fc25", "The-ATN-and-the-sausage-machine%3A-Which-one-is-Wanner/00d975899150b364784a7fc55560d789dd87aa25"]},

Rosenschein", "Stuart M. Shieber"], "date": "1982", "abstract": "A scheme for syntax-directed translation that mirrors compositional model-theoretic semantics is discussed. The scheme is the basis for an English translation system called PArR and was used to specify a semantically interesting fragment of English, including such constructs as tense, aspect, modals, and various iexically controlled verb complement structures. PATR was embedded in a question-answering system that replied appropriately to questions requiring the computation of logical entailments. I I N T R O D U C T I O N When contemporary linguists and philosophers speak of \"semantics,\" they usually mean m0del-theoretic semantics-mathematical devices for associating truth conditions with Sentences. Computational linguists, on the other hand, often use the term \"semantics\" to denote a phase of processing in which a data structure (e.g., a formula or network) is constructed to represent the meaning of a sentence and serve as input to later phases of processing. {A better name for this process might be \"translation\" or \"traneduction.\") Whether one takes \"semantics\" to be about model theory or translation, the fact remains that natural languages are marked by a wealth of complex constructions--such as tense, aspect, moods, plurals, modality, adverbials, degree terms, and sententiai complemonts--that make semantic specification a complex and challenging endeavor. Computer scientists faced with the problem of managing software complexity have developed strict design disciplines in their programming methodologies. One might speculate that a similar requirement for manageability has led linguists (since Montague, at least) to follow a discipline of strict compositiouality in semantic specification, even though model*theoretic semantics per me does not demand it. Compositionaiity requires that the meaning of a pbrase be a function of the meanings of its immediate constituents, a property that allows the grammar writer to correlate syntax and semantics on a rule-by-rule basis and keep the specification modular. Clearly, the natural analogue to compositionality in the case of translation is syntax-directed translation; it is this analogy that we seek to exploit. We describe a syntax-directed translation scheme that bears a close resemblance to model-theoretic approaches and achieves a level of perspicuity suitable for the development of large and complex grammars by using a declarative format for specifying grammar rules. In our formalism, translation types are associated with the phrasal categories of English in much the way that logical-denotation types are associated Artificial Intelligence Center SRI International 333 Raveoswood Avenue Menlo Park, CA 94025 with phrasal categories in model-theoretic semantics. The translation 'types are classes of data objects rather than abstract denotations, yet they play much the same role in the translation process that denotation types play in formal semantics. In addition to this parallel between logical types and translation types, we have intentionally designed the language in which translation rules are stated to emphasize parallels between the syntaxdirected translation and corresponding model-theoretic interpretation rules found in, say, the GPSG literature [Gazdar, forthcoming]. In the GPSG approach, each syntax rule has an associated semantic rule (typically involving functional application) that specifies how to compose the meaning of a phrase from the meanings of its constituents. In an analogous fashion, we provide for the translation of a phrase to be synthesized from the translations of its immediate constituents according to a local rule, typically involving symbol/c application and ~-conversiou. It should be noted in passing that doing translation rather than model theoretic interpretation offers the temptation to abuse the formalism by having the \"meaning\" (translation) of a phrase depend on syntactic properties of the translations of its constituents--for instance, on the order of conjuncts in a logical expression. There are several points to be made in this regard. First, without severe a priori restrictions on what kinds of objects can be translations (coupled with the associated strong theoretical claims that such restrictions would embody) it seems impossible to prevent such abuses. Second, as in the case of programming languages, it is reasonable to mmume that there would emerge a set of stylistic practices that would govern the actual form of grammars for reasons of manageability and esthetics. Third, it is still an open question whether the model*theoretic program of strong compositiouality will actually succeed. Indeed, whether it succeeds or not is of little concern to the computational linguist, whose systems, in any event, have no direct way of using the sort of abstract model being proposed and whose systems must, iu general, be based on deduction (and hence translation). The rest of the paper discusses our work in more detail. Section II presents the grammar formalism and describes PATR, an implemented parsing and translation system that can accept a grammar in our formalism and uses it to process sentences. Examples of the system's operation, including its application in a simple deductive question-answering system, are found in Section HI. Finally, Section IV describes further extensions of the formalism and the parsing system. Three appendices are included: the first contains sample grammar rules; the second contains meaning postulates (axioms) used by the question-answering system; the third presents a sample dialogue session. \"This research wns supported by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency under Contract N000SO-SO-C.-0575 with the Naval Electronic Systems Conunand.

Nodes in the parse tree are assumed to have a set of features which may assume binary values (True or False), and there is a distinguished at tr ibute-the \"translation'--whoee values range over a potentially infinite set of objects, i.e., the translations of English phrases. Viewed more abstractly, we regard translation as a binary relation between word sequences and logical formulas. The use of a relation is intended to incorporate the fact that many word sequences have several logical forms, while some have none at all. Furthermore, we view this relation as being composed (in the mathematical sense) of four simpler relations corresponding to the conceptual phases of analysis: (1) LEX (lexical analysis), (2) PARSE (parsing), (3) ANNOTATE (assignment of attribute values, syntactic filtering), and (4) TRANSLATE (translation proper, i.e., synthesis of logical form). The domains and ranges of these relations are as follows: Word Sequences -LEX-* Morpheme Sequences P A R S E * Phrase Structure Trees -ANNOTATE-* Annotated Trees -TRANSLATE-* Logical Form The relational composition of these four relations is the full translation relation associating word sequences with logical forms. The subphases too are viewed as relations to reflect the inherent nondeterminism of each stage of the process. For example, the sentence =a hat by every designer sent from Paris was felt\" is easily seen to be nondeterministic in LEX ( 'felt ' ) , PARSE (poetnominal modifier attachment), and TRANSLATE (quantifier scoping). It should be emphasized that the correspondence between processing phases and these conceptual phases is loose. The goal of the separation is to make specification of the process perspicous and to allow simple, clean implementations. An actual system could achieve the net effect of the various stages in many ways, and numerous optimizatious could be envisioned that would have the effect of folding back later phases to increase efficiency.

For example, \"went\" is mapped onto the single morpheme sequence (&past go), and \"John\" is mapped to (john). Thus, by extension, \"John went\" is transformed to (John &post go) by the lexical analysis phase. Parsing is specified in the usual manner by a context-free grammar.

One of the major results which Frazier and Fodor bring forward in support of their proposal concerns a parsing strategy which, following Kimball (1973), they call Right Association. The center-piece of their argument concerns an interaction between this parsing strategy and another one, which they call Minimal Attachment. Frazier and Fodor (henceforth FF) provide interesting evidence that the language user makes tacit use of both strategies to resolve temporary syntactic ambiguities that arise during parsing. FF then proceed to argue that the existence of these strategies, as well as the apparent interaction between them, can be fully explained if we assume that the language user\u2019s parsing system is configured along the lines of the Sausage Machine. In FF\u2019s view, the Augmented Transition Network (ATN) runs a very poor second to the Sausage Machine, for according to FF\u2019s argument, it is impossible even to describe the two parsing strategies within the ATN framework. In effect then, FF are claiming that the Sausage Machine achieves explanation adequacy in this case while the ATN fails to reach the level of descriptive adequacy. These are strong and potentially important claims. If correct, they obviously provide grounds for pursuing parsing models built along the lines of the Sausage Machine rather than the ATN. However, when FF\u2019s arguments are examined at close range, the comparison between parsing systems comes out rather differently than they claim. In particular, it appears that the Sausage Machine explanation of Right Association and its interaction with Minimal Attachment is empirically incorrect. The inadequacy of this explanation completely cancels the Sausage Machine\u2019s ability to describe the interaction between strategies that FF have observed.

As a computational problem, speech understanding reflects a large number of intrinsically interesting issues. Spoken sounds are achieved by a long chain of successive transformations, from intentions, through semantic and syntactic structuring, to the eventually resulting audible acoustic waves. As a consequence, interpreting speech means effectively inverting these transformations to recover the speaker's intention from the sound. At each step in the interpretive process, ambiguity and uncertainty arise. The Hearsay-II problem-solving framework reconstructs an intention from hypothetical interpretations formulated at various levels of abstraction. In addition, it allocates limited processing resources first to the most promising incremental actions. The final configuration of the Hearsay-II system comprises problem-solving components to generate and evaluate speech hypotheses, and a focus-of-control mechanism to identify potential actions of greatest value. Many of these specific procedures reveal novel approaches to speech problems. Most important, the system successfully integrates and coordinates all of these independent activities to resolve uncertainty and control combinatorics. Several adaptations of the Hearsay-II framework have already been undertaken in other problem domains, and it is anticipated that this trend will continue; many future systems necessarily will integrate diverse sources of knowledge to solve complex problems cooperatively. Discussed in this paper are the characteristics of the speech problem in particular, the special kinds of problem-solving uncertainty in that domain, the structure of the HearsayII system developed to cope with that uncertainty, and the relationship between Hearsay.

It is pointed out in several theorems that programs of finitely determined instructions are properly more powerful if address modification is permitted than when it is forbidden, thereby shedding some light on the role of address modification in digital computers.

DIAGRAM is an augmented phrase-structure grammar with rule procedures that allow phrases to inherit attributes from their constituents and to acquire attributes from the larger phrases in which they themselves are constituents. These attributes are used to set context-sensitive constraints on the acceptance of an analysis. Constraints can be imposed by conditions on dominance as well as by conditions on constituency. Rule procedures can also assign scores to an analysis to rate it as probable or unlikely. Less likely analyses can be ignored by the procedures that interpret the utterance. For every expression it analyzes, DIAGRAM provides an annotated description of the structure. The annotations supply important information for other parts of the system that interpret the expression in the context of a dialogue.\nMajor design decisions are explained and illustrated. Some contrasts with transformational grammars are pointed out and problems that motivate a plan to use metarules in the future are discussed. (Metarules derive new rules from a set of base rules to achieve the kind of generality previously captured by transformational grammars but without having to perform transformations on syntactic analyses.)", "references": []},

Hayes"], "date": "1977", "abstract": "A knowledge representation system is presented , based on the use of a semantic net on which a higher level structure of frames has been superimposed. The system was designed for use with a natural language system for finding the correct senses of ambiguous words in context. An examination of several linguistic examples shows how the representation system facilitates associative searches of context for potentially appropriate senses of ambiguous words, and how the results of such searches can often provide definite refer-ents. The system also embodies novel approaches to the representation of multiple subparts, and of similar, but different, entities. I Introduction Recently, there have been several attempts ([1], [2], and [4]) to make semantic nets more useful as a method of knowledge representation. All these projects have depended on use of frame-like structures ([5]); that is, they introduced a unit of representation that is on a higher level than the nodes and links of more traditional semantic nets ([6], [7]), in that it stands for the information contained in a collection of several nodes and links. These frame-like structures allow a notion of relevance or viewpoint to be implemented. In any given use of the semantic net, only some of the frames are deemed active, and the information contained in the others is ignored; in this way, the information apparently contained in the net can be made dependent on the point of view of the process accessing the net. As the several reports mentioned above show, this basic technique can be used very effectively to a number of different purposes, including the representation of quanti-fication, of variable levels of detail, of contradictory hypotheses, and of different aspects of the same object. This paper describes the application of the technique to a more specialised problem, that of word-sense disambiguation by association. By an association, I will mean some definite and systematic relation between two concepts; for example, in: When Fred arrived, his arm was covered in bandages. The woman went to the clock, and looked at the face. 99 the appropriate senses of \"arm\", \"face\", and \"hand\", respectively have associations with the appropriate senses of \"man\", \"clock\", and \"gamb-ler\". Superimposing a frame-like structure on top of a large semantic net allows the number of search steps involved in finding such associations to be reduced; in addition, defining several different classes of relationships between frames, and making the search sensitive to \u2026", "references": ["On-Overview-of-KRL%2C-a-Knowledge-Representation-Bobrow-Winograd/033ecd544c4e71b14a7d3ee0611a300a20b91232", "Expanding-the-Utility-of-Semantic-Networks-Through-Hendrix/bc587390dcf5198671fb0fa9304f52dea5afdacb", "From-PLANNER-to-CONNIVER%3A-a-genetic-approach-Sussman-McDermott/4a2986f8a3b4a385ef410bfac509ace84401e961"]},

The pictures are taken only a short time apart so that the reference features can be correlated between the pictures on the basis of spatial position alone. This velocity measurement is associated with absolute reference points superimposed over the scene. It is assumed that all parts of an object have the same velocity measurement. Thus the velocity measurements associated with the reference points provide a means of classifying them as ``belonging'' to the same object. Points ``inside'' moving objects fall into either of two velocity measurement classes, which are easily correlated.

This finding contradicts theories of word recognition which account for context effects solely by postulating transient increases in the aecessibility of only those words semantically related to the particular preceding stimuli encountered by the observer. An adequate theory must include an account of strategic or adaptive processes in which the past usefulness of contextual information modulates its influence in the word recognition process.", "references": []},

Additionally, a linear relationship was found between picture-picture and word-word latencies for individual item pairs.

Pictures produced faster decision latencies in both tasks, and the latency diflerence between pictures and words was comparable across tasks. These data fit the predictions of a unitary memory model.

Computer algorithms are described for matching the earth's disk, giving a global registration; a more precise local registration is then achieved by matching landmarks. Accurate registration is needed because the satellite cannot be given an ideal synchronous orbit and perfect attitude stability. We have experimented with landmark templates of sizes 10\u00d710 and 20\u00d720 picture elements, representing 25-mi and 50-mi squares.

The classification is along two dimensions , Force-why a person should follow the rule, and Form-what the rule looks like. For the most part it seems that any force type may combine with any form type in producing a rule. One example, how to use an umbrella, is examined in detail although facts about many human activities, from playing bridge to washing one's hair, are used as examples. I Introduction It is commonly accepted that a computer which answers questions about a natural language text must have roughly a human reader's knowledge of the subject matter. Restricting ourselves to simple stories (1 ike children's stories) the knowledge needed is that \"common sense\" knowledge which all members of a particular culture share. Since, by all indications even this knowledge is quite extensive, it will have to be well organized and classified before a computer will be able to make much use of it. In this paper I will be concerned with classifying the kinds of facts we have about actions. Some typical facts of the sort I will be concerned with are: (Fl) In giving a present the giver should give something the receiver would like to get. (F2) When painting some object it is a good idea to put paper on the floor under the object so as not to get paint on the floor. Some facts which would not be included in this study, as they are intuitively not about actions, are: (F3) The Earth has one moon. (F4) Few people like modern music. Furthermore, this study will be restricted to facts like (F1)-(F2) which tell us something about how to perform an action, as opposed to facts like: <F5) Many people break their legs while skiing. (F6) At playing chess, nobody is much better than Bobby Fisher. Intuitively it seems to me that the \"how to do it\" type facts form a natural subclass of knowledge , so that by restricting the study to them I will not be hopelessly distorting the results. Naturally it would be preferable to have some firm evidence on this point, but short of already having a better taxonomy, it is hard to imagine what the evidence could be.

For flexibility, there must be many frames of reference with respect to which coordinates are measure. The resulting representation supports many tasks, including finding routes from one place to another. In the past, AI researchers have often sought to reduce spatial reasoning to topological reasoning. [4, 6, 81 For example, the important problem of finding routes was analyzed as the problem of finding a path through a network or tree of known places. This sort of formulation throws away the basic fact that a route exists in real physical space regardless of our knowledge of any of the places along the way. So a network-based algorithm will fail to exhibit two important phenomena of route-finding: > Often you know roughly what direction to go in without having any idea of the details of the path, or even if the path is physically possible. > You can tell immediately that you don't know how to get to a place, just by verifying that you don't know the direction to that place. There are many other problems that a topological approach fails to treat adequately. Here are some of the problems we (Ernie Davis, Mark Zbikowski and I> have worked on: > How are metric facts, such as \"A is about 5 miles from B\" or \" The direction from A to B is north\" to be stored? > How are queries such as \"Is it farther A to B than from A to C?\" to be answered? from > Given a large set of objects and facts relating them, how do you find the objects that might be near some position? or with some orientation? Some of these problems have received more of our attention than others. In what follows, I will sketch our approach, the details of various algorithms and data structures, and the results we have so far. All of our solutions revolve around keeping track of the fuzzy coordinates of objects in various frames of reference.

Bobrow", "Terry Winograd"], "date": "1977", "abstract": "ion. There is no commitment in KRL as to what sorts of concepts in the domain should be represented at what level of categorization. The specific three types are based on psychological studies (Rosch, 1975; Rosch & Mervis, 1975) that human reasoning makes extensive use of a layered system of categories. The choice of whether a particular prototype (such as Person or Visit) should be basic, abstract, or a specialization depends on the way in which descriptions are built up and used in matching. What is provided is a mechanism by which the careful use of levels can result in achieving many of the efficiency benefits of semantic marker mechanisms and classification trees. Individuals. The KRL matcher and other primitive mechanisms for building SThis includes much of the work on semantics associated with transformational grammar (e.g., Katz & Fodor, 1964), A1 formalisms such as conceptual dependency (Schank, 1975a), and most , forms of case grammar (see Bruce, 1975, for a summary). Ernis tree corresponds to a simple generalization hierarchy, as discussed in Winograd (1975a). 12 ' D. G. BOBROW AND T. WINOGRAD descriptions assumes that different individuds are different unique entities in the world being modeled. For example, no individual can match (in a simple sense) a different individual. An inconsistency is signaled whenever there is an attempt to use pointers to two different individuals as descriptors in a single description. However, there are no built-in assumptions about how individuality should be assigned. The definition of what, should constitute anindividual within .a domain is relative to a particular set of reasoning purposes. As a simple example, in the, air travel domain, a particular flight (including date) could be an individual, with the flight number as a property (filling a slot), or, alternatively, each flight in the schedule (by number) could be treated as an individual, with a particular flight instance represented as a manifestation (see below). Manifestations. Often it is useful to group together a set of descriptions which belong to some individual. There are three main cases in which we anticipate this need, and units with category type manifestation can be used for all of them: 1. Further specified individuals: A manifestation can be used to provide a single memory unit (for purposes of retrieval and content-dependent description) containing a set of descriptions belonging to an individual within one context. For example, we might separate out the physical properties of an object for which we also have functional or historical descriptions, or the description of some person as a scientist from the description of that person as a friend. 2. Contingent properties: An individual can be described using timedependent descriptions without creating a separate manifestation. However, it is often useful to collect a set of descriptions which are true at some time (or in some hypothesized world) and treat them as time-independent descriptions of a manifestation which represents the individual at that particular time. 3. Ghosts: A representation must enable us to describe entities whose unique identity is not known. There are many cases in which we may know many properties of some object without knowing which of the known objects in our world it is. Such objects have at times been called \"formal objects\" (Sussman, 1975) and \"ghosts\" (Minsky, 1975). A standard detective story plot involves knowing that one of the people in a house is a murderer, knowing many properties of the murderer, and not knowing which individual it is. The unit used to represent the murderer is a manifestation that has no' associated individual. Relations and propositions. An abstract relationship, such as the relative magnitude of two numbers, can be described using the ideas of slots and description we have used so far. There is a unit, with category class relation, which represents the relationship (or predicate) as an abstract mapping; a proposition unit represents each instantiation of the relationship. The truth value of a proposition is specified explicitly rather than being determined as an implicit consequence of its existence in the data base. AN OVERVIEW OF KRL 13 2.4 The Family of Descriptors Each descriptor in a description is an independent characterization of the object associated with the description. The variety of descriptor types corresponds to the notion of natural description discussed above. Each descriptor type is intended to express a different mode of describing conceptual objects. The syntax of descriptors depends on key words (such as a , the, from, which) based on analogy with simple English phrases. They are mnemonic indicators for a set of precisely defined structures within the formalism. This set of descriptors was not designed with the goal of boiling everything down to the smallest possible set of mechanisms. On the contrary, it is based on an attempt to provide a simple and nahlral way of stating information conceptualized in di.fferent ways. There is a great deal of overlap. For example, the notion of \"bachelor\" might be represented in any of the following ways: There could be a prototype unit for Bachelor, with an individual described as (a Bachelor with. . .) Bachelorhood could be represented .indirectly by having a prototype for MalePerson and Adult, and a predicate for IsMarried, and using the description: {(a MalePerson) (an Adult) (NOT (which IsMarried))) There could be a unit representing a Marriage with slots for the malepartner and fernaleparmer, and a description: {(a MalePerson) (an Adult) (NOT (the malepartner from (a ~ a n i a ~ e ) ) ) ) There could be a one-place predicate, IsBachelor. The predicate definition might (but need not) include a special procedural test for bachelorhood. An individual would then be described using the predication (which IsBachelor) These KRL forms are described in general in Fig. 3. No one of these forms is automatically primary. All of them could coexist, and be defined in terms of each other. The system provides the necessary reasoning mechanisms to interrelate the different forms in which essentially equivalent information could appear, and the hope is that additional knowledge (especially procedural knowledge) which is best stated with respect to any one form can be represented directly. Our intuition leads us to believe that prototypes and perspectives will most often -serve as the fundamental organizing representation, with the others serving to provide secondary information. In order to demonstrate the different uses of these descriptors, we present here a more extended example. It is based on a hypothetical system that acts as a travel assistant, making reservations and computing costs of trips. As with the example above, this is greatly oversimplified and is not intended as a careful 14 D. G. BOBROW AND T.

Pollack", "Fernando Pereira"], "date": "1988", "abstract": "We report on a mechanism for semantic and pragmatic interpretation that has been designed to take advantage of the generally compositional nature of semantic analysis, without unduly constraining the order in which pragmatic decisions are made. To achieve this goal, we introduce the idea of a conditional interpretation: one that depends upon a set of assumptions about subsequent pragmatic processing. Conditional interpretations are constructed compositionally according to a set of declaratively specified interpretation rules. The mechanism can handle a wide range of pragmatic phenomena and their interactions. 1 I n t r o d u c t i o n Compositional systems of semantic interpretation, while logically and computationally very attractive [6,20,26], seem unable to cope with the fact that the syntactic form of a a utterance is not the only source of information about its meaning. Contextual information--information about the world and about the history of a discourse-influences not only an utterance's meaning, but even its preferred syntactic analysis [3,5,7,16]. Of course, context also influences the interpretation (or meaning in context) of the utterance, in which, for example, referring expressions have been resolved. One possible solution is to move to an integrated system of semantic and pragmatic interpretation, defined recursively on syntactic analyses that are 1 This research has been funded by DARPA under Contract N00039-84-C-0524, and by a gift from the Systems Development Foundation as par t of a coordinated research effort with the Center for the Study of Language and Information, Stanford University. We would like to thank David Israel, FLay Perrault, and Stuart Shieber for their helpful discussions regarding this work. neutral about those decisions that depend upon context. In this approach, a least-commitment grammar may be used to produce neutral representations that can be reconfigured later. Such a grammar might, for example, leave quantifiers in place [30], at tach all prepositional phrases low and right [22], and bracket to the right all compound nominals. 2 These neutral analyses can then serve as input to a system that produces interpretations (and not meanings) in a nearly compositional manner, in that the interpretation of a phrase a is a function of the interpretations of its syntactic constituents together with its context of utterance. This model of semantic interpretation assumes that contextual information is available whenever it is needed for deciding among alternative interpretations. However, this is often not the case: questions about the interpretation of some constituent of an utterance might be answerable only when information about the interpretation of syntactically distant constituents becomes available. Familiar examples of this can be found, for instance, in sentences with quantifier scoping ambiguities and in sentences that include intrasentential anaphora. The so-called donkey sentences [9] exhibit both these phenomena. These difficulties do not necessitate a complete abandonment of compositionality. To take advantage of the generally compositional nature of semantic analysis without constraining unduly the order in which pragmatic decisions are made, we assign to phrases conditional interpretations, 2Tllere are reasons to suspect that ultinmtely syntactic analysis should be incorporated into the same stage of processing as semantic and pragnuLtic analysis; in particular, it is difficult to develop syntactically neutral representations for certain constructions such as conjunction. 3For simplicity, we shall use the term \"phrase\" to refer bo th to an entire utterance and to a constituent of an utterance, distinguishing betweeal the two only when needed.", "references": ["Nominalizations-in-PUNDIT-Dahl-Palmer/f2eb8510f4b08b4f0a865c193ec2efb4cc69134f", "A-Theory-for-the-Representation-of-Knowledge-Guenthner-Lehmann/850dd516fc5324d770814e4e47866a00b148a6da", "Attention%2C-Intentions%2C-and-the-Structure-of-Grosz-Sidner/59485516f2e600f2bfe274a5e67a3b5177626bb1", "Compilers%3A-Principles%2C-Techniques%2C-and-Tools-Aho-Sethi/9a292e0d862debccffa04396cd5bceb5d866de18", "Overview-of-the-TACITUS-Project-Hobbs/1bbb6277b2780f05fd7927caa7316f295445f9c5", "Procedural-knowledge-Georgeff-Lansky/38511ec04533cf66bd0c6c6377994c461771bd8f"]},

An experiment was conducted in which four-consonant strings containing exactly zero or two acoustically confusable items were recalled in order after retention intervals of 3, 8, or 18 intervening digits, all characters being successively presented at a rate of 400 msec per item and read aloud by the subject. An analysis of errors in relation to intra-and extrastimulus sources of acoustic confusion, retention interval, and serial position produced results that refute hypothesis (a) and support hypothesis (b). The implications of the present results for an adequate theory of the short-term retention of ordered strings are indicated. Of the possible information about a stimulus that could be stored in memory at the time of input, the information actually stored can be inferred in part from the type of errors subjects make in recall. For example, Conrad (1964, 1965) has observed that when subjects are required to recall strings of letters, a disproportionate number of their overt errors are intrusions of letters that share acoustic features with the correct letter. Not only do such errors of acoustic confusion constitute a large pro-authors are indebted to William K. Estes and Robert A. Bjork for their substantial contributions to the design and analysis of the present experiment, and to James T. Townsend for his interest and suggestions concerning the theoretical issues examined in the present paper. portion of the errors subjects make in recalling letter strings, but the proportion changes dramatically as a function of retention interval: At short retention intervals subjects make many more acoustic confusion errors than would be expected by chance, while at long retention intervals they make only slightly more acoustic confusion errors than would be expected by chance (Conrad, 1967). A similar shift in the ratio of confusion to nonconfusion errors as a function of retention interval has been reported by Estes (1970, 1972). Primarily on the basis of these and similar observations regarding the frequency and distribution of acoustic confusion errors, the basic format of short-term memory is argued to be auditory or acoustic. In particular, it is argued that the phonemic structure of letters is somehow represented, stored, and rehearsed in \u2026", "references": []},

Thus, though the pattern of stimulated skin receptors remains constant, the perceived orientation of the letter reverses. On the basis of this observation it is proposed that tactual perception of object form involves assignment of a spatial coordinate system within which the patterns of skin stimulation are interpreted. In experiments in which the orientations of letters and subjects are systematically varied within the environment, the occurrence or nonoccurrence of reversal in perceived orientation of letters has been used to investigate the origin of the proposed spatial coordinate system; that is, whether it is assigned with respect to the observer ( egocentrically ) or with respect to the environment ( geocentrically ). The results indicate that the assignment of coordinates is determined by both egocentric and geocentric factors. It is proposed that the reversal phenomena observed in these experiments, and in experiments of others which involve drawing characters on the skin, are consistent with Gibson's proposal that it is object form which is directly perceived, but that this involves interpretation of the patterns of skin stimulation within a framework of spatial coordinates.", "references": []},

In the latter application, for example, it is desirable to be able to recognize conditions in the message that instantiate conditions in the antecedents of the expert system's rules, so that the expert system can reason on the basis of more up-to-date and more specific information. More broadly, our aim is to develop general procedures, together with the underlying theory, for using commonsense and technical knowledge in the interpretation of written discourse.

A single semantic definition is used for both nominalizations and the verbs to which they are related, with the same semantic roles, decompositions, and selectional restrictions on the semantic roles. However, because syntact ical ly nominalizations are noun phrases, the processing which produces the semantic representat ion is different in several respects from tha t used for clauses. (1) The rules relating the syntact ic positions of the consti tuents to the roles tha t they can fill are different. (2) The fact tha t nominailzations are untensed while clauses normally are tensed means tha t an al ternat ive t rea tment of time is required for nomlnalizations. (3) Because none of the arguments of a nominallzation is syntactically obllgatory, some differences in the control of the filling of roles are required, in part icular , roles can be filled as par t of reference resolution for the nominalization. The differences in processing are captured by allowing the semantic interpreter to operate in two different modes, one for clauses, and one for nominalizations. Because many nomlnalizations are noun-noun compounds, this approach also addresses this problem, by suggesting a way of dealing with one relatively tractable subset of noun-noun compounds. 1Formerly SDC-A Burroughs Company.", "references": []},

Joshi"], "date": "1983", "abstract": "Shared knowledge and beliefs affect conversational situations in various ways. One aspect in which they play a role is the choice of referring expressions. It is of interest to analyse this role since a natural language system must be able to decide when it can use a particular referring expression; or alternatively what a particular expression refers to. In this paper we attempt to formally characterise conditions for these. Specifically, we differ with the traditional notion of mutual knowledge and belief, state a conversational conjecture that convinces us to do so, express a weakened notion in a formal system for reasoning about knowledge, and show how this might be used to decide on satisfactory referring expressions. It is desirable to express a weakened notion of mutual belief that parallels that for mutual knowledge; this aspect is currently being investigated. 1.0 INTRODUCTION built so that it mirrors in some way the reasoning process of humans, rather than doing reasoning that is purely logical. This latter is an important criterion, since a system to be used in a conversational environment must be able to reason about the beliefs of others in the same manner that they would about them. Insofar as producing cooperative behaviour impinges on the task of understanding and generating natural language, it is already evident that considerations of knowledge and belief are important for natural language processing. However, there are aspects of language processing that are affected more directly by beliefs and knowledge about others and of what beliefs and knowledge are shared with others. Consider for example the aspect of using or understanding a referring expression. In trying to refer to an object one takes recourse to the facts that one thinks or knows one's audience believes or knows; and a system that does not make the assumption that it communicates with people who know all that it knows must be able to do the same. Representing and reasoning about the knowledge and beliefs of the participants in an interaction is an important consideration for a system like a natural language interface to a knowledge base, designed to exhibit cooperative behaviour. The ability, for example, to understand the primary intent of a query or statement, predict the expectations of the participants so as to attempt to satisfy them, or understand or use referring expressions appropriately depend crucially on this aspect of the system.

Schubert"], "date": "1984", "abstract": "Applying the rules of translation is even simpler. In essence, all that is needed is a mechanism for arranging There are various difficulties in accomodating the traditional logical expressions into larger expressions in conformity with mass/count distinction into a grammar for English which the semantic rules. (For examples of parsers see Thompson has a goal the production of \"logical form\" semantic translations of the initial English sentences, The present paper surveys some of these difficulties. One puzzle is whether the distinction is a syntactic one or a semantic one, i.e., whether it is a well-formedness constraint or whether it is a description of the semantic translations produced. Another puzzle is whether it should be applied to simple words (as they occur in the lexicon) or whether it should apply only to longer units (such as entire NPs). Of the wide variety of possible theories, only two seem to produce the required results (having to do with plausible inferences and intuitively satisfying semantic representations). These two theories are developed and compared. According to Montague (Thomason 1974), Gazdar (Gazdar et al 1984) and a rapidly growing number of linguists, philosophers, and AI researchers, the logical form underlying sentences of a natural language are systematically--and simply--determined by the syntactic form of those sentences. This view is in contrast with a tacit assumption often made in AI, that computation of logical translations requires throngs of more or less arbitrary rules operating upon syntactic forms.* The following are a few grammar rules in approximately the style of Gazdar's Generalized Phrase Structure Grammar (GPSG). They differ from Gazdar's primarily in that they are designed to produce more or less \"conventional\" logical translations, rather than the intensional ones of Montague and Gazdar (for details see Schubert & Pelletier 1982). Each rule consists of a rule number, a phrase structure rule, and a semantic (logical translation) rule. 1. S . , NP VP, VP'(NP') 2. V P . , [V +be] PRED, PRED' 3. PILED .* N, N' N,={water,wine,food,furniture,...} Parsing and translating in accordance with such rules is a fairly straightforward matter. Since the syntactic rules are context free, standard context-free parsing methods can be employed, except that allowance must be made for the propagation of features, with due regard for concord.

Alberta Logical Grammar Study Group for discussions on these topics. 1981, Schubert & Pelletier 1982, Gawron et al 1982, Rosenschein & Shieber 1982). The topic of mass terms and predicates has a substantial literature within both linguistics and philosophical logic, with much of the recent research deriving inspiration from Montague Grammar (e.g., see Pellefier 1979, ter Meulen 1980, Bunt 1981, Chierchia 1982). There are three views on the mass/count distinction, namely that the distinction is (a) syntactic, (b) semantic,, and (c) pragmatic, Orthogonal to these views we have the further possibilities (i) that the mass/count distinction is lexical. and (ii) that it is determined by the context in which the expression occurs. We shall present arguments in the full paper to eliminate position (c), leaving us with four possible kinds of theories. ( i ) a syntactic expression (lexical) approach, (2) a syntactic occurrence approach. (3) a semantic expression approach, and (4) a semantic occurrence approach. This raises the question of what is the difference between syntactic approaches generally and semantic approaches generally. A syntactic approach treats +mass and +count as syntactic classifications or features, that is as features to be used by the syntactic rules in determining whether some longer stretch of words is well-formed. Central to the semantic approach is the claim that +count and +mass are not syntactic features or categories, but rather are a description of the semantic representation of the expression. In this approach, no syntactic rules refer to +count or +mass (since these are not syntactic objects). Rather, in sentences like Mary put apple in the salad vs. Mary put an apple in the. salad, the semantic approaches allow us to say that it was a mass or count semantic representation of apple only after inspecting the kind of thing that apple is true of in the", "references": ["From-English-to-Logic%3A-Context-Free-Computation-of-Schubert-Pelletier/7537566fcb1a8ffa481195d94f4960d5d1d5c2ef"]},

Of central importance in this effort is the axiomatization of what might be called \"commonsense metaphysics'. This includes a number of areas that figure in virtually every domain of discourse, such as scalar notions, granularity, time, space, material, physical objects, causality, functionality, force, and shape. Our approach to lexical semantics is then to construct core theories of each of these areas, and then to define, or at least characterize, \u2022 large number of lexical items in terms provided by the core theories. In the TACITUS system, processes for solving pragrnatics problems posed by \u2022 text will use the knowledge base consisting of these theories in conjunction with the logical forms of the sentences in the text to produce an interpretation. In this paper we do not stress these interpretation processes; this is another, important aspect of the TACITUS project, and it will be described in subsequent papers. This work represents a convergence of research in lexical semantics in linguistics and efforts in AI to encode commonsense knowledge. Lexical semanticist* over the years have developed formalisms of increasing adequacy for encoding word meaning, progressing from simple sets of features (Katz and Fodor, 1963) to notations for predicateargument structure (Lakoff, 1972; Miller and JohnsonLaird, 1976), but the early attempts still limited to world knowledge and assumed only very restricted sorts of processing. Workers in computational linguistics introduced inference (Rieger, 1974; Schank, 1975) and other complex cognitive processes (Herskovits, 1982) into our understanding of the role of word meaning. Recently, linguists have given greater attention to the cognitive processes that would operate on their representations (e.g., Talmy, 1983; Croft, 1986). Independently, in AI an effort arose to encode large amounts of commonsense knowledge (Hayes, 1979; Hobbs and Moore, 1985; Hobbs et al. 1985). The research reported here represents a convergence of these various developments. By developing core theories of several fundamental phenomena and defining lexical items within these theories, using the full power of predicate calculus, we awe able to cope with complexSties of word meaning that have hitherto escaped lexical semanticists, within a framework that gives full scope to the planning and reasoning processes that manipulate representations of word meaning.", "references": []},

Collins [l] has shown that there are many different modes of reasoning that a subject can use to show that he is ignorant of something; some of these, for example, involve the subject reasoning about the limitations of his own information-gathering and memory abilities. This paper will consider a single type of inference about ignorance, which we call circumscriptive ignorance. We present a partial formalization of circumscriptive ignorance and apply it to the Wise Man Puzzle.' 1. Circumscriptive Ignorance The premise that there is a limited amount of information, resources, or strategies available for the solution of a problem is often an unstated but essential part of the problem abstraction. For example, in the Missionaries and Cannibals Puzzle, it is important that only a single boat is available to ferry people across the river; one cannot invoke a helicopter brigade from the Sudan to solve the puzzle. McCarthy [5] has investigated the first-order formalization of problem statements such as this, using a circumscription schema to capture unstated limitations on resources. In puzzles that involve reasoning about the knowledge agents possess, there are often unstated conditions on the initial information given an agent, as well as on the information he can acquire. In the Wise Man Puzzle (see Section 3 below for a full statement of this puzzle), it is common knowledge that each man can see his neighbors' spots and knows from the king that there is at least one white spot. It is an unstated condition of the puzzle that this is the only knowledge that wise men have about the initial situation; in an adequate formalization of the puzzle it should be possible to prove that each wise man is ignorant of the color of his own spot in the initial situation. In effect, the knowledge that is available to the agents in the puzzle is being circumscribed; informally one would say \" The only facts that agent S knows about proposition p are F. \" If from the facts F it is not possible for S to infer p (or-p), then S does not know whether p is true. Proving ignorance based on a limitation on the knowledge available to an agent will be called reasoning by circumscriptive ignorance.

A new Bayesian statistical foundation for the operations promises further improvement MRL proposes to build a software framework running on processors onboard the new Uranus mobile robot that will maintain a probabilistic, geometric map of the robot\u2019s surroundings as it moves, The certainty grid representation will allow this map to be incrementally updated in a uniform way based on information coming from various sources, including sonar, stereo vision, proximity, and contact sensors The approach can correctly model the fuzziness of each reading and, at the same time, combine multiple measurements to produce sharper map features; it can also deal correctly with uncertainties in the robot\u2019s motion The map will be used by planning programs to choose clear paths, identify locations (by correlating maps), identify well-known and insufficiently sensed terrain, and perhaps identify objects by shape. The certainty grid representation can be extended in the time dimension and used to detect and track moving objects Even the simplest versions of the idea allow us to fairly straightforwardly program the robot for tasks that have hitherto been out of reach MRL looks forward to a program that can explore a region and return to its starting place, using map \u201csnapshots\u201d from its outbound journey to find its way back, even in the presence of disturbances of its motion and occasional changes in the terrain.

Horrigan"], "date": "1977", "abstract": "Introduction A problem that is currently of some interest in connection with the development of conversational systems is that of dealing with the context m which the individual utterances of a dialog are embedded. have pointed out, the plans of the speakers are a crucial element of the context of a dialog. Knowledge of how speakers communicate intentions via their utterances seems, then, to be important to the success of a conversational system. This problem has been addressed by workers in disciplines other than Artificial Intelligence. Iftc encoding of speaker intention in single utterances has been studied by Searle (Searle(1975)) in his work on 'speech acts'. Communication of speaker intention via larger discourse units has been studied by the linguists Sinclair and Coulthard (Sinclair and Coulthard(1975)) in their work on the structure of pedagogical dialogs. Our effort involved applying the work of Searle and that of Sinclair and Coulthard to the problem of understanding the speaker intention communicated in utterances of actual dialogs from a simple domain. The Dialog Model We developed and tested a model for about one hundred dialogs which we recorded between passengers and a clerk at an information booth in a train station. By inspection of the dialoq transcripts, wc discovered a small set of discourse 'acts', each of which indicates a well-defined speaker intention. For instance, one such act, called an 'ack.heard.ok', indicates that the speaker believes he correctly heard the immediately preceding utterance. Tn general, the definition of an act may involve preceding utterances, and may express expectations about the acts to follow. We describe these interrelationships in terms of higher-level discourse units, called 'moves', which are themselves interrelated and described in terms of each other. Many of these moves consist in the speaker uttering an act and then listening for a response, to determine whether the act in fact achieved the purpose for which it was intended. Our description, then, leans strongly to the view, suggested especially by the work of Pruce, that the structures we observe in our dialogs result from the structures of the interacting plans of the participants in those dialogs. Utterances are intended either to further the speaker's own plan or to provide feedback to the other participant on the status of his (inferred) plan.", "references": []},

Jerrold Kaplan"], "date": "1978", "abstract": "Casual users of Natural Language (NL) computer systems are typically inexpert not only with regard to the technical details of the underlying programs, but often with regard to the structure and/or content of the domain of discourse. Consequently, NL systems must be designed to respond appropriately when they can detect a misconception on the part of the user. Several conventions exist in cooperative conversation that allow a speaker to indirectly encode their intentions and beliefs about the domain into their utterances, (\"loading\" the utterances), and allow (in fact, often require) a cooperative respondent to address those intentions and beliefs beyond a literal, direct response. To be effective, NL computer systems must do the same. The problem, then, is to provide practical computational tools which will determine both when an indirect response is required, and wh-~ that response should be, without requiring that large amounts of domain dependent world knowledge be encoded in special formalisms.

The implication is nearly made that adding a temporal dimension to the research (on engineering, medical diagnosis, etc.) would be a familiar but tedious exercise that would obscure the new material presented by the author. Actually, of course, no one has ever dealt with time correctly in an AI program, and there is reason to believe that doing it would change everything. Because time has been neglected, medical diagnosis programs cannot talk about the course of a disease. Story understanding programs have trouble with past events. Problem solvers have had only the crudest models of the future, in spite of the obvious importance of future events. Many researchers have compensated by modeling the course of external time with the program\u2019s own internal time, changing the world model to reflect changing reality. This leads to a confusion between correcting a mistaken belief and updating an outdated belief. Most AI data bases have some sort of operator for removing formulas. (e.g., ERASE in PLANNER, Hewitt, 1972) This operator has tended to be used for two quite different purposes: getting rid of tentative or hypothetical assertions that turned out not to be true, and noting that an assertion is no longer true. The confusion is natural, since some of the same consequences must follow in either case. For example, if \u2018\u2018The car is drivable\u2019\u2019 follows from \u2018\u2018There is gas in the car,\u2019\u2019 then the former statement must be deleted when the latter is, whether you have discovered there to be no gas after all, or the gas has been used up. But in many cases, the two behave quite differently, and efforts to make them the same have resulted in awkward, inextensible programs. For example, from \u2018\u2018x is beating his wife,\u2019\u2019 you are entitled to infer, \u2018\u2018x is a bad man.\u2019\u2019 But if x pauses to catch his breath, only the former statement must be deleted from the data base. Clearly, the proper inference is from \u2018\u2018If x has beat his wife recently, he is a bad man,\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018x is beating his wife,\u2019\u2019 to \u2018\u2018For the next year or so, x will have beaten his wife recently,\u2019\u2019 and hence to", "references": ["A-Common-Representation-for-Problem-Solving-and-Charniak/8bda61d86d93b9e887fdd78fa630cc5f4b6223e1", "Mental-Models-in-Cognitive-Science-Johnson-Laird/30851405b993dbfe2dd62b58df090793b60a1111", "A-Truth-Maintenance-System-Doyle/58ad80040a7a707a8000dcae730b9ce7eab93197", "Planning-and-Acting-McDermott/d7d927cda381864aeaf4f4d2aa15d5ec05ffcdee", "Framed-PAINTING%3A-The-Representation-of-a-Common-Charniak/d6f1a9cd8fc49cd20be3458a94c8f45efa59d5e6", "Reasoning-About-Knowledge-and-Action-Moore/6a6bfc2d27fe3c3a88d8fd5c21d9c3e2cc93ccaf", "An-Organization-of-Knowledge-for-Problem-Solving-Rieger/0dc8b5d3452ddfd26b998cd923f4c46cdd80faca"]},

Allen Emerson", "Joseph Y. Halpern"], "date": "1983", "abstract": "Temporal logic ([PR57], [PR67]) provides a formalism fordescribing the occurrence of events in time which is suitable forreasoning about concurrent programs (cf. [PN77]). In definingtemporal logic, there are two possible views regarding theunderlying nature of time. One is that time is linear: at eachmoment there is only one possible future. The other is that timehas a branching, tree-like nature: at each moment, time may splitinto alternate courses representing different possible futures.Depending upon which view is chosen, we classify (cf. [RU71]) asystem of temporal logic as either a linear time logic in which thesemantics of the time structure is linear, or a system of branchingtime logic based on the semantics corresponding to a branching timestructure. The modalities of a temporal logic system usuallyreflect the semantics regarding the nature of time. Thus,in a logicof linear time, temporal operators are provided for describingevents along a single time path (cf. [GPSS80]). In contract, in alogic of branching time the operators reflect the branching natureof time by allowing quantification over possible futures cf.[AB80],[EC80]).\nSome controversy has arisen in the computer science communityregarding the differences between and appropriateness of branchingversus linear time temporal logic. In a landmark paper [LA80]intended to \"clarify the logical foundations of the application oftemporal logic to concurrent programs,\" Lamport addresses theseissues. He defines a single language based on the temporaloperators \"always\" and \"sometimes\". Two distinct interpretationsfor the language are given. In the first interpretation formulaemake assertions about paths, whereas in the second interpretationthey make assertions about states. Lamport associates the formerwith linear time and the latter with branching time (although itshould be noted that in both cases the underlying time structuresare branching). He then compares the expressive power of lineartime and branching time logic. Based on his comparison and otherarguments, he concludes that, while branching time logic issuitable for reasoning about nondeterministic programs, linear timelogic is preferable for reasoning about concurrent programs.\nIn this paper, we re-examine Lamport's arguments and reachsomewhat different conclusions. We first point out some technicaldifficulties with the formalism of [LA80]. For instance, thedefinition of expressive equivalence leads to paradoxicalsituations where satisfiable formulae are classified as equivalentto false. Moreover, the proofs of the results comparing expressivepower do not apply in the case of structures generated by a binaryrelation like those used in the logics of [FL79] and [BMP81]. Wegive a more refined basis for comparing expressive power thatavoids these technical difficulties. It does turn out thatexpressibility results corresponding to Lamport's still hold.However, it should be emphasized that these results apply only tothe two particular systems that he defines. Sweeping conclusionsregarding branching versus linear time logic in general are notjustified on this basis.\nWe will argue that there are several different aspects to theproblem of designing and reasoning about concurrent programs. Whilethe specific modalities needed in a logic depend on the precisenature of the purpose for which it is intended, we can make somegeneral observations regarding the choice between a system ofbranching or linear time. We believe that linear time logics aregenerally adequate for verifying the correctness of pre-existingconcurrent programs. For verification purposes, we are typicallyinterested in properties that hold of all computation paths. It isthus satisfactory to pick an arbitrary path and reason about it.However, there are applications where we need the ability to assertthe existence of alternative computation paths as provided by abranching time logic. This arises from the nondeterminism - beyondthat used to model concurrency - present in many concurrentprograms. In order to give a complete specification of such aprogram, we must ensure that there are viable computation path acorresponding to the nondeterministic choices the program mightmake. (An example is given in section 6.) Neither of Lamport'ssystems is entirely adequate for such applications.\nIn order to examine these issues more carefully, we define alanguage, CTL*, in which a universal or existential path quantifiercan prefix an arbitrary linear time assertion. CTL* is an extensionof the Computation Tree Logic, CTL, defined in [CE81] and studiedin [EH82]. This language subsumes both of Lamport's interpretationsand allows us to compare branching with linear time. Moreover, thesyntax of CTL* makes it clear which interpretation is intended.\nThe paper is organized as follows: In section 2 we summarizeLamport's approach and discuss its limitation. In section 3 wepresent the syntax and semantics of CTL*. We also define somenatural sublanguages of CTL* and compare their expressive power inSection 4. In particular, we show that (cf. Theorem 4.1) a languagesubstantially less expressive than CTL* still subsumes both ofLamport's interpretations. Section 5 then shows how CTL* can beembedded in MPL [AB80] and PL [HKP80]. Finally, section 6 concludeswith a comparison of the utility of branching and linear timelogic.", "references": []},

Model integration is based on a process of reinforcing the confidence in consistent information while decaying the confidence in inconsistent information.

Pierrehumbert"], "date": "1986", "abstract": "We propose a mapping between prosodic phenomena and semantico-pragmatic effects based upon the hypothesis tha t intonation conveys information about the intent ional as well as the attentional s t ructure of discourse. In part icular, we discuss how variations in pitch range and choice of accent and tune can help to convey such information as: discourse segmentat ion and topic structure, appropriate choice of referent, the dist inction between 'given' and 'new' information, conceptual contrast or parallelism between mentioned items, and subordinat ion relationships between propositions salient in the discourse. Our goals for this research are practical as well as theoretical. In part icular, we are invest igat ing the problem of intonat ional assignment in synthetic speech. 1. I n t r o d u c t i o n The role of prosody in discourse has been generally acknowledged but l i t t le understood. Linguistic pragmaticis ts have noted tha t types of i n f o r m a t i o n s t a t u s (such as g l v e n / n e w , t o p l c / c o m m e n t , f o c u s / p r e s u p p o s i t i o n ) can be intonationally 'marked ' [1,2,3,4], t ha t r e f e r e n c e r e s o l u t i o n may depend critically on intonat ion [5, 6], t ha t intonat ion can be used to disambiguate among potent ial ly ambiguous ut terances [7,8], and tha t i n d i r e c t s p e e c h ac t s may be signalled by intonat ional means [9,10,11]. Conversational analysis of natural ly occurring da ta has found tha t speakers may signal t o p i c sh i f t , d i g r e s s i o n , and i n t e r r u p t i o n , as well as t u r n t a k i n g , intonationally [12, 13, 141 . And the fact tha t intonat ional contours contribute in some way to ut terance in terpreta t ion is itself unexceptionable [8]. To date, however, identification of the prosodic phenomena involved -and the proper mapping between thcse phenomena and their semantico-pragmatic effects -has been largely intui t ive, and the intonat ional phenomena involved have not been precisely described. Here, we describe how certain of the resources of the intonational system are employed in discourse. In part icular, we discuss how speakers ' choice of p i t c h r a n g e , a c c e n t , and t u n e contribute to the i n t e n t i o n a l and a t t e n t l o n a l s t ructur ing of discourse -the way speakers communicate the relationships among their discourse goals and the relative salience of entities, a t t r ibutes , and relationships mentioned in the discourse) Our findings emerge from an intensive s tudy of a simple example of speech synthesis: the script of a computer-aided instruct ion system, TNT (Tutor 'n ' Trainer) [16], which employs synthet ic speech to tu tor computer novices in the text editor vi. Using the Text to Speech system (TTS) i17], we have been able, by systematic variat ion of pitch 1. Grosz and Sidaer [15] propose a tripartite view of discourse structure: a llngnlstlc structure, which is the text/speech itself; an attentlonal structure, including information about the relative salience of objects, properties, relations, and intentions at a given point in the discourse; and an Intentional structure, which relates dlscourse segment purposes (those purposes whose recognition is essential to a segment achieving its intended effect) to one another. range and by a principled choice of accent and tune, to highlight the s t ructure of the tutor ia l text and thus to enhance its coherence. While most studies of how intonat ion is used in discourse, have been based solely on examination of intonat ional contours found in a na tura l corpus, we have found tha t intonat ion synthesis provides a unique oppor tuni ty to manipulate the dimensions of variat ion orthogonally. Thus we can pinpoint factors crucial for a given effect and evaluate various pa t terns for a given ut terance and context. 2. T h e D o m a i n TNT was designed to teach computer-naive subjects vi, a simple UNIX screen-oriented text editor. The tu tor ia l portion provides a brief introduct ion to word processing, to general features of vi, and to the tu tor ' s help facilities; the tu tor then guides subjects through a series of learning tasks of graduated difficulty. While the overall task s t ructure is implici t in the tu tor ia l text, the subject can influence the course of the interact ion via h is /her manipulation of a set of 'helper ' keys; these keys provide hints (HINT) and reminders (REMIND) as well as the option of s ta r t ing a task over again (DO OVER) or suspending the tutor ia l temporari ly (HOLD). The fact t ha t TNT is explicitly task-oriented, 2 makes it a good test-bed for our purposes. An appropriate segmentat ion of the text, and a notion of the purpose of each segment and the hierarchical relat ionships among segments, can be independently determined from the task at hand. Also, certain characterist ics of the text presented a par t icular ly interest ing challenge for our study. First , the script contains l i t t le pronominal reference and very few so-called clue words words and phrases such as now, next, returning to, but, and on the other hand, which can identify discourse segment boundaries and relationships among segments, signal in terrupt ions and digressions, and so on [19,20]. Both of these phenomena (together with intonation) have been identified as impor tan t s trategies for communicat ing discourse structure [15,18,19]. Their vir tual absence from the text presents a convenient oppor tuni ty for test ing the power of intonat ion to s t ructure a discourse. Second, while we were not able to isolate points in the text where subjects had special difficulties, we did informally observe certain general problems with t u r n t a k i n g 3 in the tu tor -specifically, it was not always clear when the tu tor ' s turn was over which we addressed in our synthesis of the text. 3. FO S y n t h e s i s To synthesize the fundamental frequency (f0) contours for the TNT script, we used the intonat ion synthesis program 2. That is, the tutorial is organized around a series of data processing tasks, which the subject is guided through. See [18] for discussion of the characteristics of task-oriented domain discourse. 3.

One attitude-an optimistic one-is that cognitive science already exists and is alive and flourishing in academe: we have all in our different ways been doing it for years. The gentleman in Moliere\u2019s play rejoiced to discover that he had been speaking prose for forty years without realizing it: perhaps we are merely celebrating a similar discovery. And, if we just keep going on in the same way, then we are bound to unravel the workings of the mind. Another attitude-my own-is more pessimistic: experimental psychology is not going to succeed unaided in elucidating human mentality; artificial intelligence is not going to succeed unaided in modelling the mind; nor is any other discipline-linguistics, anthropology, neuroscience, philosophy-going to have any greater success. If we are ever to understand cognition, then we need a new science dedicated to that aim and based only in part on its contributing disciplines. Yet pessimism should not be confused with cynicism. We should reject the view that cognititie science is merely a clever ruse dreamed up to gain research funds-that it is nothing more than six disciplines in search of a grant-giving agency. Cognitive science does not quite exist: its precursors do, but it lacks a clear identity. Perhaps the major function of this conference should be to concentrate our minds on what that identity might be. At present, there appear to be two distinct ideas wrapped up in it: one topic-oriented, and the other methodological. The topic-oriented idea is that workers from several disciplines have converged upon a number of central problems and explanatory concepts.

Eric L. Grimson", "Tom\u00e1s Lozano-P\u00e9rez"], "date": "1985", "abstract": "This paper discusses how sparse local measurements of positions and surface normals may be used to identify and locate overlapping objects. The objects are modeled as polyhedra (or polygons) having up to six degrces of freedom relative to the seneors. The approach operates by examining all hypotheses abont I,airings betvvxn sensed data and object surfaces and efficiently discarding inconsistent ones by using local constraints On: distances between faces, angles between face normals, and angles (relative to the surface normals) of sectors between sensed points. The described here is an extension of a method for recognition aItd localization of non-overlapping parts preViOwlY described in [Grimson & Lozano--P&rez 84) and [Gaston 2 LoZano-PCrez 841. 1. Problem Definition The specific problem we consider in this paper is how to identify a known object and locate it, relative to the sensor, using relatively few measurements. We want a recognition technique t,hat is applicable to a wide range of scnsors, so we make few assumptions about the sensory data availablc. We assume only that the sensory data can be proce~ed to obtain sparse measurements of the position and surface orientation of small planar patches of object surfaces in some coordinate frame defined relat,ive to the sensor. The measured positions are assumed to be within a known crror volume and measured surface orientations to be within a known error cone. Furthermore, the object is assumed to be overlapped by other nnknown object,s, so that, much of t,he data does not arise from the object of interest. If the object5 have only three degrees of freedom relative to the sensor ( two translational and one rotational), then the positions and surface normals need only be two-dimensional. If the objects have more than three degrees of freedom (np to three translational and three rotational), the position and orientation data must be three-dimensional. Since the measured data approximate small planar patches of the object\u2019s surface, we assume that the objects can be modeled as sets of planar faces. Only the individual plane equations and dimensions of the model faces are used for recognition and localization. No face conncctivity information is used or assumed; the model faces do not wen have to be connected. This is important. Acknowledgments. This report describes research done at the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory of the Massachusetts Institute of Tc:chnology. Support for the Laboratory\u2019s Artificial Intelligence rcsearch is provided in part by a grant from the Systcm 1)evelopment f?oundation, and in part by the Advanced Research Projects Agency nnder Ofice of Naval Research contracts N0001480-C-0505 and N00014-82-K-0334. I t is easy to build polyhedral approximations of moderately curved objects, but we cannot expect these approximations to bc perfectly stable under sensor variations. The connectivity among the faces is particularly vulnerable. Since our recognition method does not use face connectivity, but only local geometry, it can be readily applied to curved objects approximated by planar patches. Our basic approach to recognition proceeds in two steps: Generate Feasible Interprrtationa: A set of feasible interpretations of tilr senw data iu constructed. interpretations consist of pairings of rach sensed patch wilh some object surface on one of the known objccts. Interprclations inconsistent with local constraints, derived from the model, on the sense data are discarded. Model Test: The feasible interpretations are tested for consistency with surface equations obtained from the object models. An interpretation is legal if it is possible to solve for a rotation and translation that would place each senscd patch on an object surface. The sensed patch must lie inside the object face, not just on the surface defined by the equation. There are several possible methods of actually searching for consistent matches. For example, in Grimson and Lozano-PCrez [84] we chose to structure the seaich as the generation and exploration of an interpretation tree. That is, starting st a root nodk, we construct a tree in a depth first fashion, assigning mcawred patches to model faces. At the first level of the tree, we consider assigning the first measured patch to all possible. faces, at the next level, we assign the second measured patch to all possible face$, and 90 on. The number of possible interpretations in this tree, given a sensed patches and n surfaces, is n6. Therefore, it is not feasible to rxplore the entire search space in order to apply a model test t,o all possible interpretations. Moreover, since the computation of coordinate frame transformations tends to be expensive, we want to apply this part of the technique only as needed. The goal of the recognition algorithm is thus to exploit local geometric constraints to minimize the number of interpretations that necd testing, while keeping the computational cost of each constraint small. In the case or the interpretation tree, we need constraints betwern t,he data elements and the model elements that will allow us t,o remove entire subtrees from corlsideration without explicitly having to search those subtrees. In our case, we require that the distances and angles between a l l pairs of data elements be consistent with the distanccs and anglcs possible between their aysigned model elernents. The recognition algorithm described is related to several recent approaches to reccgnition based on geometric constraints [Rob and Cain 82, Bolles, Ilorand and Hannah 83, Faugeras and Hebert 53, Gaston and Lozano-Bkrez 84, Grimson and Lozano-1\u2019L.rez 84, Stockman arld Estcva 841.

Since no sentence is ever perceived outside some context, it is reasonable to inquire into the nature of context as it affects the interpretation of sentence meaning at a deep conceptual level. A theory, called conceptual oyer-l ays, is described. This theory (1) defines C(T 1 ,... ,T i), the context established by the meaningful sequence of thouqhts T 1 T j : (2) defines I(T j+ 1 , C(T 1 ,... T j)), the high-level interpretation of Ti+i in the context established by Ti,...,Ti; and (3) specifies an effective algorithm and data structure for computing I(t,K) for arbitrary thought T in context K. In particular, a prototype LISP system, EX-SPECTRE-1, which solves simple cases of I(T 2 .,C(T 1)) is described. The system is based on an expectancy/fulfillment paradigm. Expectan-cies are spontaneously activated by a pattern-directed invocation technique. Each expectancy implicitly references large chunks of common-sense algorithms. A collection of such implicitly activated algorithms constitutes context, and the interpretive process is one of identifying future input as steps in these algorithms.

A computer program was written which drove the Cart through cluttered spaces, gaining its knowledge of the world entirely from images broadcast by an on-board TV system. The CMU Rover is a more capable, and neatly operational, robot being built to develop and extend the Stanford work and to explore new directions. The Cart used several kinds of stereopsis to locate objects around it in three dimensions and to deduce its own motion. It planned an obstacle-avoiding path to a desired destination on the basis of a model built with this information. The plan changed as the Cart perceived new obstacles on its journey. The system was reliable for short runs, but slow. The Cart moved 1 m every 10 to 15 min, in lurches. After rolling a meter it stopped, took some pictures, and thought about them for a long time. Then it planned a new path, executed a little of it, and paused again. It successfully drove the Cart through several 20-m courses (each taking about 5 h) complex enough to necessitate three or four avoiding swerves; it failed in other trials in revealing ways. The Rover system has been designed with maximum mechanical and control system flexibility to support a wide range of research in perception and control. It features an omnidirectional steering system, a dozen on-board processors for essential real-time tasks, and a large remote computer to be helped by a high-speed digitizing/data playback unit and a high-performance array processor. Distributed high-level control software similar in organization to the Hearsay II speech-understanding system and the beginnings of a vision library are being readied. By analogy with the evolution of natural intelligence, we believe that incrementally solving the control and perception problems of an autonomous mobile mechanism is one of the best ways of arriving at general artificial intelligence.", "references": []},

The second condition, which is strictly speaking a condition on S as a whole, Goodman referred to as the contenability of S with 4. The problem with (ii) as it stands is that it involves a counterfactual construction; any such account for the truthconditions of counterfactuals must, therefore, be circular. Furthermore, there does not appear to be a simple alternative characterisation of cotenability which is free from counterfactual constructions. Goodman himself thought that the only possible way to escape from this circularity would be to account for the truth-conditions of counterfactuals in terms of underlying natural laws; and a theory of lawlikeness which would include a solution of his socalled projection problem. Unfortunately, as Goodman himself emphasises, this would destroy his original claim to explicate the concept of law by reference to counterfactuals. Worse still, it now appears that the projection problem, which Goodman subsequently cameto see as the kernel of the problem of lawlikeness, can in its turn only be solved if we appeal to certain laws. Bob Stalnaker and David Lewis independently developed theories which, although they do not solve completely the problem of truth-conditions, say enough about it to clarify to a large extent the logic of conditionals. Stalnaker supposes that the circumstances in which we use a conditional (1) determine a function (f, say) which maps sentences onto alternative situations in which the sentences are true.

The establishment of standards by which the model's performance can be compared with that of humans on closely related tasks. The comprehension of dialogue is an important concern for those interested in natural language processing for several reasons: dialogue gives particularly good access to human communication phenomena, it is less contrived than authored text, and human dialogue provides useful analogies for improving man-machine communication. In naturally occurring dialogues, the goals of the participants play a key role in structur ing their language interactions. People know how dialogue is used to achieve goals, and they use this knowledge to comprehend what they hear. We have represented this knowledge in structures called Dialogue-games, which differ from other multisentential knowledge structures by representing knowledge about how language is used to pursue goals rather than the structure of the content being conveyed. These Dialogue-games, which govern such activities as helping, information seeking, giving instructions, announcing, and testing someone's knowledge, are part of a strongly goal-oriented model of language comprehension. This model is composed of autonomous processes which operate on shared memories. Each of the four memories (a long-term memory and a short-term memory for each of two participants) is a collection of predicate expressions representing the individual's fixed knowledge and current awareness. An important part of this research has focused on the problem of model evaluation. Benchmarks for use in evaluating model performance have been developed, creating opportuni t ies for empirical validation of the effectiveness of natural language process models. The modeling effort described here has led to progress on several problems of natural language comprehension it provides an explanation for topic changes, serves as a basis for limiting inferences, accounts for the comprehension of a number of different kinds of implicit communication, and suggests ways that formal man-machine communication could be improved. It thus illustrates the utility of an overall goal-or iented view of language.

The notion of script is introduced to account for knowledge about mundane situations. A program, SAM, is capable of using scripts to under\u00ad stand. The notion of plans is introduced to ac\u00ad count for general knowledge about novel situa\u00ad tions. I. Preface In an attempt to provide theory where there have been mostly unrelated systems, Minsky (1974) recently described the as fitting into the notion of \"frames.\" Minsky at\u00ad tempted to relate this work, in what is essentially language processing, to areas of vision research that conform to the same notion. Mlnsky's frames paper has created quite a stir in AI and some immediate spinoff research along the lines of developing frames manipulators (e.g. Bobrow, 1975; Winograd, 1975). We find that we agree with much of what Minsky said about frames and with his characterization of our own work. The frames idea is so general, however, that It does not lend itself to applications without further specialization. This paper is an attempt to devel\u00ad op further the lines of thought set out in Schank (1975a) and Abelson (1973; 1975a). The ideas pre\u00ad sented here can be viewed as a specialization of the frame idea. We shall refer to our central constructs as \"scripts.\" II. The Problem Researchers in natural language understanding have felt for some time that the eventual limit on the solution of our problem will be our ability to characterize world knowledge. Various researchers have approached world knowledge in various ways. Winograd (1972) dealt with the problem by severely restricting the world. This approach had the po\u00ad sitive effect of producing a working system and the negative effect of producing one that was only minimally extendable. Charniak (1972) approached the problem from the other end entirely and has made some interesting first steps, but because his work is not grounded in any representational sys\u00ad tem or any working computational system the res\u00ad triction of world knowledge need not critically concern him. Our feeling is that an effective characteri\u00ad zation of knowledge can result in a real under\u00ad standing system in the not too distant future. We expect that programs based on the theory we out\u00ad \u2026", "references": ["Does-a-Story-Understander-Need-a-Point-of-View-Abelson/5a211a174b98e1769c6af93c0d36258a36633274"]},

The F0 contours were characterized by schematic patterns [J. Vaissi\u00e8re Res. Lab. Electron., Q. Prog. Report No. 115, MIT, 251-262 (1975)]. For all the sentences that were studied, the configurations of patterns frequently observed in the analyzed corpus were judged most natural when synthesized. This result suggests that the features of the F0 contours most relevant to naturalness are preserved in the pattern representation. Three types of patterns were distinguished: (1) a prominent, demarcative pattern (P2); (2) A PROMINENT, NOndemarcative pattern (PE); (3) nonprominent, nondemarcative patterns, A P2 pattern often occurred at the end of a syntactic constituent. Listeners' judgements showed that a P2 at the end of a syntactic constituent is rarely required for naturalness, but a P2 in contradiction to syntax causes unnaturalness. Prominent patterns (P2 or PE) often occurred on negatives, adverbs, and quantifiers. However, the presence or absence of a prominent pattern on these words does not affect naturalness.", "references": []},

Responses are closely correlated with F0: the most steeply falling intonation contours are identified as being declarative, the least falling ones as being interrogative, and contours in the middle of the continuum as being nonfinal. Several mutually interdependent parameters in the F0 course may account for the results, the two most powerful one, however, being the levels of the last stressed and the succeeding unstressed syllable, respectively, in the utterance. In a subsequent experiment, seven subjects identified the same utterances as being either declarative or nondeclarative. The majority of the (formerly) nonfinal sentences were now labeled nondeclarative, rather than being equally distributed among the declarative and nondeclarative categories. When a subset of the same utterances were multilated, identification deteriorated almost progressively with the number of syllables being cut away from the end of the utterance, but only slightly so until nothing but the first stress group remained; whereas, syllables cut away from the beginning hardly affected identification at all.", "references": []},

The plan representation is of major theoretical interest because it includes not only data flow and control flow relationships between subsegments of a program, but also goal-subgoal, prerequisite, and other logical dependencies between the specifications of the subsegments. Plans are utilized both for describing particular programs and in the compilation of a knowledge base of more abstract knowledge about programming, such as the concept of a loop and various specializations, such as enumeration loops and search loops.

The major theoretical goal of the research is to further develop a formal representation for teleological structure, called plans, which will facilitate both the abstract description of particular programs, and the compilation of a library of programming expertise in the domain of non-numerical computation. Adequacy of the theory will be demonstrated by implementing a system (to eventually become part of a LISP Programmer's Apprentice) which will be able to recognize various plans in LISP programs written by human programmers and thereby generate cogent explanations of how the programs work, including the detection of some programming errors.

This problem can become critical if these structures are being used to support access paths, like indexes, to data base systems. In this case, serializing access to one of these indexes can create an unacceptable bottleneck for the entire system. Thus, there is a need for locking protocols that can assure integrity for each access while at the same time providing a maximum possible degree of concurrency. Another feature required from these protocols is that they be deadlock free, since the cost to resolve a deadlock may be high. Recently, there has been some questioning on whether B-tree structures can support concurrent operations. In this paper, we examine the problem of concurrent access to B-trees. We present a deadlock free solution which can be tuned to specific requirements. An analysis is presented which allows the selection of parameters so as to satisfy these requirements. The solution presented here uses simple locking protocols.

Moreover, since an insert operation can exactly invert the effect of a delete operation, and vice versa, a sequence of m inserts and deletes can cause 8 (m logd n) splits and merges. We. present a scheme that reduces the number of splits and merges required to process m inserts and deletes to 0(m), while only modestly increasing the depth of the tree. On the surface it may not seem advantageous to limit the number of splits and merges. Before performing an insert or delete operation, it is generally necessary to perform a tree search involving 8(logd n) nodes. There are situations, however, where the number of splits and merges is the bounding factor in the time to insert and delete. If the application involves locality of reference that is, inserts and deletes tend to occur in close proximity in the tree maintaining \u2018fingers\u2019 that point into the tree can reduce search time substantially below 8(logd n) [2]. Furthermore, searching involves only reading the contents of nodes, while splitting and merging require modifying nodes. With certain storage strategies, writing into the tree is more costly than reading from the tree. B-trees are often proposed as index structures in databases. In a concurrent database environment, multiple processes can search the tree simultaneously,", "references": []},

Brown", "Robert E. Tarjan"], "date": "1980", "abstract": "In this paper we explore the use of 2-3 trees to represent sorted lists. We analyze the worst-case cost of sequences of insertions and deletions in 2-3 trees under each of the following three assumptions: (i) only insertions are performed; (ii) only deletions are performed; (iii) deletions occur only at the small end of the list and insertions occur only away from the small end. Our analysis leads to a data structure for representing sorted lists when the access pattern exhibits a (perhaps time-varying) locality of reference. This structure has many of the properties of the representation proposed by Guibas, McCreight, Plass and Roberts [A new representation for linear lists, Proc. Ninth Annual Symposium on Theory of Computing, Boulder, CO, 1977, pp. 49-60], but it is substantially simpler and may be practical for lists of moderate size. Key words, analysis of algorithms, deletion, finger, insertion, sorted list, 2-3 tree Introduction. The 2-3 tree [1] is a data structure which allows both fast accessing and fast updating of stored information. For example, 2-3 trees may be used to represent a sorted list of length n so that a search for any item in the list takes O(log n) steps. Once the position to insert a new item or delete an old one has been found (via a search), the insertion or deletion can be performed in O(log n) additional steps. If each insertion or deletion in a 2-3 tree is preceded by a search requiring D.(log n) time, then there is little motivation for improving the above bounds on the worst-case time for insertions and deletions. But there are several applications of 2-3 trees in which the regularity of successive insertions or deletions allows searches to proceed faster than f(log n). One example is the use of a sorted list represented as a 2-3 tree to implement a priority queue [6, p. 152]. In a priority queue, insertions are allowed anywhere, but only the smallest item in the list at any moment can be deleted. Since no searching is ever required to find the next item to delete, an improved bound on the cost of consecutive deletions might lead to a better bound on the cost of the method as a whole. In this paper, we prove several results about the cost of sequences of operations on 2-3 trees. In 1 we derive a bound on the total cost of a sequence of insertions (as a function of the positions of the insertions in the tree) which is tight to within a constant factor. In 2 we derive a similar bound for a sequence of deletions. If the sequence of operations is allowed to include intermixed insertions and deletions, there are cases in which the naive bound cannot be improved: 0(log n) steps per operation may be required. However, we show in 3 that for the priority queue application mentioned above, a mild assumption about the distribution of insertions implies that such bad cases cannot occur. In 4 we explore some consequences of these results. We propose a modification of the basic 2-3 tree structure which allows us to save a finger to an arbitrary position in the tree, with the property that searching d positions away from the finger costs O(log d) steps (independent of the tree size). Fingers are inexpensive to move, create, * Received by the editors January 24, 1979. i Computer Science Department, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut 06520 :!: Computer Science Department, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305.

Harper, Payne, Savage and Strauss [1] show that N<supscrpt>2</supscrpt>1og<subscrpt>2</subscrpt>N comparisons suffice to sort X + Y, thereby saving a factor of 2 over sorting without exploiting the structure of X + Y. (Given u in X + Y, we assume that we know the i,j indices such that u &equil; x<subscrpt>i</subscrpt> + y<subscrpt>j</subscrpt>.) Furthermore, they show that this bound is tight for a restricted class of comparison algorithms. However, without their restriction the order of magnitude comparison complexity of this problem has remained an open question. In this paper we show that X + Y can be sorted with O(N<supscrpt>2</supscrpt>) comparisons. Our proof is unusual for this type of problem in that we do not explicitly exhibit an algorithm. Instead, it is a particular application of a more general search technique whose behavior is easily related to information theoretic lower bounds. In the context of sorting, this search method translates into an insertion sort, where the insertions are not performed by means of the usual binary search, but rather as off-centered searches designed so that each comparison, roughly speaking, equally divides the space of remaining possibilities. We draw attention to this search technique because it might find application to other problems, and we illustrate this possibility with a second application.\n Our second application concerns the construction of probabilistically balanced binary search trees.", "references": []},

Presented and discussed are the kinds of knowledge necessary for interpreting references to actions, as well as algorithms for using that knowledge in interpreting dialog utterances about ongoing tasks and for drawing inferences about the task situation that are based on a given interpretation.", "references": []},

The ~ notation has not become very common, although I have noticed its use in a few places, most recently in some Russian publications I consulted about the theory of equidistributed sequences. Once I had suggested to someone in a letter that he use ~-notation \"since it had been used by number theorists for years\"; but later, when challenged to show explicit references, I spent a surprisingly fruitless hour searching in the library without being able to turn up a single reference. I have recently asked several prominent mathematicians if they knew what ~(n 2) meant, and more than half of them had never seen the notation before.

A set of constraints for sparse sensory data that are applicable to a wide variety of sensors are derived, and their characteristics are examined.

Like the underlying researen itself, the paper is focused on the human engineering involved in designing practical rnd comfortable interfaces. This focus has lead to the investigation of some generally neglected facets of language processing, including the processing of Ireomplfte inputs, the ability to resume parsing after recovering from spelling errors and the ability for naive users to input English stat.emert s at run time that, extend and person-lize the language accepted by the system. The implementation of these features in a convenient package and their integration with other human engineering features are discussed. There has been mounting evidence that the current state of the art in natural language processing, although still relatively primitive, is sufficient for dealing with some very real problems. For example, Brown and Burton (1975) have developed a usable system for computer assisted instruction, and a number of language systems have been developed for interfacing to data bases, including the REL system developed by Thompson and Thompson (1975), the LUNAR system of Woods et al. (1972), and the PLANES system ol Walt7 (1975). The SIGART newsletter for February, 1977, contains a collection cf 5? short overviews of research efforts in the general area of natural language interfaces. Tnere has rise been a growing demand for application systems. At SRi's Artificial Irtellugene Center alone, many programs are ripe for the addition of language capabilities, Including systems for data base accessing, industrial automation, automatic programming, deduct ior, and judgmental reasoning. The appeal cf these systems to builders ana users .-'like is greatly enhanced when they are able to accept natural language inputs. B.

Under the assumption that the computer is operating at the mere threshhold of its capacity in performing the tasks we have thus far delegated to it, a long-range program directed at the problem of \"intelligent\" behavior and learning in machines has been established at the IBM Research Center in New York (Gelernter and Rochester, 1958). In particular the technique of heuristic programming is under detailed investigation as a means to the end of applying large-scale digital computers to the solution of a difficult class of problems currently considered to be beyond their capabilities; namely those problems that seem to require the agent of human intelligence and ingenuity for their solution. It is difficult to characterize such problems further, except, perhaps, to remark rather vaguely that they generally involve complex decision processes in a potentially infinite and uncontrollable environment. If, however, we should restrict the universe of problems to those that amount to the discovery of a proof for a theorem in some well-defined formal system, then the distinguishing characteristics of those problems of special interest to us are brought clearly into focus. We should like our machine to be able to prove many of the theorems presented to it in a formal system that is manifestly undecidable. Further, as the machine 134 gains \"experience\" in proving theorems, we should expect it to be able to solve problems that were earlier beyond its capabilities. The requirement that a machine should deal with undecidable systems places a fundamental restriction on its modus operandi. Finding a suitable algorithm, the obvious technique for the solution of problems on a digital computer, is no longer acceptable for the simple reason that no such algorithm exists. An exhaustive search for the initial axioms and theorems of the proof, combined with exhaustive development of the proof sequence by systematically applying the rules of transformation until the required proof has been produced, has been shown to be much too time-consuming for so simple a logic as propositional calculus (Newell, Shaw and Simon, 1957 a). It is a fortiori out of the question for any of the more interesting logics. A remaining alternative is \u2026", "references": []},

The program simulates the behavior of subjects in experiments involving the rote learning of nonsense syllables. A discrimination net which grows is the basis of EPAM's associative memory. Fundamental information processes include processes for discrimination, discrimination learning, memorization, association using cues, and response retrieval with cues. Many well-known phenomena of rote learning are to be found in EPAM's experimental behavior, including some rather complex forgetting phenomena. EPAM is programmed in Information Processing Language V.\n H. A. Simon has described some current research in the simulation of human higher mental processes and has discussed some of the techniques and problems which have emerged from this research. The purpose of this paper is to place these general issues in the context of a particular problem by describing in detail a simulation of elementary human symbolic learning processes.\n The information processing model of mental functions employed is realized by a computer program called Elementary Perceiver and Memorizer (EPAM). The EPAM program is the precise statement of an information processing theory of verbal learning that provides an alternative to other verbal learning theories which have been proposed. It is the result of an attempt to state quite precisely a parsimonious and plausible mechanism sufficient to account for the rote learning of nonsense syllables. The critical evaluation of EPAM must ultimately depend not upon the interest which it may have as a learning machine, but upon its ability to explain and predict the phenomena of verbal learning.\n I should like to preface my discussion of the simulation of verbal learning with some brief remarks about the class of information processing models of which EPAM is a member.\n a. These are models of mental processes, not brain hardware. They are <u>psychological</u> models of mental function. No physiological or neurological assumptions are made, nor is any attempt made to explain information processes in terms of more elementary neural processes.\n b. These models conceive of the brain as an <u>information processor</u> with sense organs as input channels, effector organs as output devices, and with internal programs for testing, comparing, analyzing, rearranging, and storing information.\n c. The central processing mechanism is assumed to be serial; i.e., capable of doing only one (or a very few) things at a time.\n d. These models use as a basic unit the <u>information symbol</u>; i.e., a pattern of bits which is assumed to be the brain's internal representation of environmental data.\n e. These models are essentially <u>deterministic</u>, not probabilistic. Random variables play no fundamental role in them.", "references": []},

In this form it can be added into the memory.\nBoth factual assertions for the memory and the capabilities for correctly relating text to the memory's prior content are to be taught to the program as they are needed. TLC presently contains a relatively small number of examples of such assertions and capabilities, but within the system, notations for expressing either of these are provided. Thus the program now corresponds to a general process for comprehending language, and it provides a methodology for adding the additional information this process requires to actually comprehend text of any particular kind.\nThe memory structure and comprehension process of TLC allow new factual assertions and capabilities for relating text to such stored assertions to generalize automatically. That is, once such an assertion or capability is put into the system, it becomes available to help comprehend a great many other sentences in the future.

Recent systems have accomplished this by simply duplicating some essential item of data at several levels. Such duplication makes the storage of even small data bases inefficient; for large masses of data, storage becomes economically unfeasible. Other systems have provided the means to specify and construct hierarchies, but none have provided language that affords control over retrieval and output levels, and control over the scope of output.\n Within the Time-Shared Data Management System (TDMS), currently being produced at System Development Corporation, a method has been devised for maintaining hierarchical associations within logical entries of a data base. Basically, the technique permits the automatic association of related data through a device known as a repeating group.

Introduction While expert systems have traditionally been built using large collections of rules based on empirical associations (e.g., [S]) interest has grown recently in the use of systems that reason from representations of structure and function (e.g., [8], [7], [5]). Our work explores the use of such models in troubleshooting digital electronics. We view the task as a process of reasoning from oenavlor to structure, or more precisely, from misbehavior to structural defect. We are typically presented with a machine c-xhibitmg some form of incorrect behavior and must infer the structural abberation that is producing it. The task is interesting nnd difficult because the devices we want to examine are complex and because there IS no well developed theory of diagnosis for them. Our ultimata goal is to provide a level of performance comparabie to that of an experienced engineer, including reading and reasoning from schematics; selecting, running, and This report describes research done at the Artificial lntclligencc Laboratory of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

We require (i) a language for describing structure, (ii) a language for describing function, and (/;I) a set of prlnciplcs for troublesllooting that uses the two descriptions to guide its invosligation. This paper describes our progress to date on each of tnuse elements. In discussing iroubleshosi;ng we St IOW why tire traditional approach to reasoni,lg ahout digital electronics --test generation .solves a diflercnt problem and we discuss a number of its prPctic.31 shortcomings. We considar pext the style of c!ebugging known as violated expectations and demonstrate why it is a fundamental advance over traditional test generation. Further explcration of the violated expectation approach, however, demonstrates that it is incapable of dealing with commonly known classes of faults. We explain the shortcoming as arising from the us c of a fault model that is both implicit and inseparable from the basic troubleshooting methodology. We argue for the importance of fault models that are explicit, separated from the troubleshooting mechanism, and retractable in InUCh the same sense that inferences are retracted in current systems. Structure Description By structtire description we mean topology --the connectivity of components. A number of structure description languages have been developed, but most, having originated in work or; machine design, deal exclusively with fu~~tiOff~/ components, rarely making any provision for describing pl~y~ical organization.\u2019 In doing machine diagnosis. however, we are dealing with a collection of hardware whose functional and physical organizations are both important. The same gate may be both (i) functionally a part of a multlplexor, which is functionally a part of a datapath, etc.. and (ii) physically a part of chip E67, which is physically part of board 5, etc. Both of theso hierarchies are relevant at different times in the diagnosis and both are included in our language. We use the functional hierarchy as the primary organizing principle because, as noted, our basic task involves rensonirlg from function to structure rather than the other way around.\u2019 The functional organization is also typically richer than the structural (more levels to the hierarchy, more terms in the 1. This is curiously true even for languages billing themselves as computer hardware descripfron languages. They rarely mention a piece of physical hardware. 2. \u2018Gc arti iypicnliy confronted with a machine that misbehaves, not one that has visible structural damage. 137 From: AAAI-82 Proceedings.

Compare, for example, the functional orqanization of a board (e.g., a memory controller with cache, address translation hardware, etc.) with the physical organization (1 pc board, 137 chips). The most basic level of our description vocabulary is built on three concepts: modules, ports, and ternjinals (Fig. 1). A module can be thought of as a standard black box. A module has at least two ports; ports are the place where information flows into or out of a module. Every port has at least two terminals, one terminal on the outside of the port and one or more inside. Terminals are primitive elements; they store logic levels representing the information flowing into or out of a device through their port, but are otherwise devoid of substructure. dinput-k4D\u201d~ -1 sum\u201d\u201c\u201d Figure 1 The basic terms used in structure description. Two modules are attached to one another by superimposing their terminals. In Fig. 1, for example, wire A is a module that has been attached to input-l of the adder rnodule in this fashion. The language is hierarchical in the usual sense; modules ai any level rnay have substructure. In practice, our descriptions terminate at the gate level in the functional hierarchy and the chip level in the physical hierarchy. since for ollr purposes these are black boxes --only their behavior (or misbehavior) matters. Fig. 2 shows the next level of structure of the adder and illustrates why ports rnay have multiple terminals on their inside: ports provide the important function of shifting level of abstraction. It may be useful to think of the information flowing along wire A as an integer between 0 and 15, yet we need to be able to map those four bits Into the four single-bit lines insider the adder. Ports are the place where such infornlation is kept. T&y have machinery (described below) that allows them to map information arriving at their outer terminal onto their Inner terminals. The default provided in the system accomplishes the sirnple rnap required in Fig. 2. Since our ultimate intent is to deal with hardware on the scale of a mainframe computer, we need terms in the vocabulary capable of describing levels of organization mole substantial than the terms used at the circuit level. We can, for example, refer to horizontal, vertical, and hitslice organizations, describing a memory, for instance, as \u201ctwo rows of five 1K ram\u2019s\u201d. We use these specifications in two ways: as a description of the organization of the device and a specification for the pattern of interconnections among the components. Our eventual aim is to provide an integrated set of descriptions that span the lebels of hardware organization ranging from interconnection of individual modules, through higher level of organization of modules, and eventually on up through the register transfer and PMS level [2]. Some of this requires inventing vocabulary like that above, in other places (e.g., PMS) Figure 2 Next level of structue of the adder. we may able to make use of existing terminology and concepts. The structural description of a module is expressed as a set of commands for building the module. Hence the adder of Fig. 2 is described by indicating how to \u201cbuild\u201d it (Fig. 3). These commands are then executed by the system, causing it to build data structures that model all the components and connections shown. The resultmg data structures are organized around the individual components. Executing the first expression of Fig. 3, for example, produces 4 data structures that model the individual slices of the adder. (def i nernodul e adder (repeat 4 i (part sl ice-i adder-s1 ice) (run-wire (input-l adder) (input-l slice-i)) (run-wire ( input-2 adder) (input-2 slice-i)) (run-wire (output slice-i) (suln adder)) (repeat 3 i (run-wire (carry-out slice-i) (carry-in sl ice-[i f-l])) )) Figure 3 Parts are described by a palhname through the part hierarchy, e.g., (input-l adder). (This dcscrlptlon can be abbreviated as a bitslrce organization, but IS expanded here for illustration.) This approach to structure description offers two interesting properties: (a) a natural merging of procedural and object-oriented descriptions, and (b) the use of analogic representations. To see the merging of descriptions, note that we have two different ways of thinking about structure. We describe a device by indicating how to build it (the procedural view), but then want to think about it as a collection of individual objects ", "references": ["Expert-Systems%3A-Where-Are-We-And-Where-Do-We-Go-Davis/6096c42d21769f86328a916efe3f002281de2990", "Causal-Understanding-of-Patient-Illness-in-Medical-Patil-Szolovits/88c772564094973e7169d928f68b1f0934276287"]},

Applications of this technique to multitasking, coroutines, backtracking, label-valued variables, and functional arguments are discussed.

In ABEL, this description includes data about the patient as well as the program's hypothetical interpretations of these data in a multilevel causal network. Proceeding from the lowest level, the concepts and relations gradually shift in content from pathophysiological to syndromic knowledge.

Brown"], "date": "1981", "abstract": "This paper is about rule-based problem solving. It has a motto: The less a rule can do, the better the effects of using it can be predicted. This motto suggests the key to obtaining coherent behavior by avoiding exponential behavior (combinatorial explosion) in a problem solving program for the domain of synthesizing numerical computer programs from their non-procedural specifications Introduction To construct an automatic programming system, several separate but related sub-domains and their corresponding experts are required. These include program understanding, specification acquisition, program verification, and program synthesis. The last is the domain of expertise of the system described by this paper. A program synthesis system takes a specification (for example, a predicate calculus description of the relationships between the inputs and the outputs) of a program and produces a program meets those specifications. Diagram \"Bernoulli Example\" shows an input specification (in mathematical notation) and the LISP code produced by the system. The fundamental difficulty in constructing problem-solving systems is the so-called \"combinatorial explosion\" problem. That is to say, given a reasonable measure of how hard the problem at hand should be, a \"combinatorially explosive\" problem solver takes an amount of time proportional to an exponential (or worse!) function of that measure In general, the size of program (and therefore certainly the time needed to write it) is an unbounded function of the size of its specification For purposes of measuring the coherence of a problem solver, a measure of \"how hard a problem is\" could be the number of rule applications that were needed (as opposed to the larger number actually performed) in the solution found. The result of this research is a collection of techniques (embedded in a synthesis system) that synthesize numerical computer programs. These techniques do not depend strongly on the fact that the task is synthesizing programs, so there is hope that they could be adapted to problem-solving in other domains. I conjecture that these techniques in fact run in time proportional to a polynomial function of the number of rules required to solve a synthesis problem A working program was obtained that (on a relatively unloaded PDP-IO) can solve several examples faster than an expert human programmer.", "references": ["Synthesis%3A-Dreams-Programs-Manna-Waldinger/9a40f24f7249ae95c6ea45f3b44bc38c1cdedf8b", "A-Transformation-System-for-Developing-Recursive-Burstall-Darlington/93ccefbb580ea4c5c00ec8cc3981bb9cf42a8192", "Unit-Refutations-and-Horn-Sets-Henschen-Wos/5a5afb08f496be63c98687f4fb6ae64ecb2b1059"]},

Sacerdoti"], "date": "1977", "abstract": "This paper discusses an effort in the application of artificial intelligence to the access of data from a large, distributed data base over a computer network. A running system is described that provides real-time access over the ARPANET to a data base distributed over several machines. The system accepts a rather wide range of natural language questions about the data, plans a sequence of appropriate queries to the data base management system to answer the question, determines on which machine(s) to carry out the queries, establishes links to those machines over the ARPANET, monitors the prosecution of the queries and recovers from certain errors in execution, and prepares a relevant answer. In addition to the components that make up the demonstration system, more sophisticated functionally equivalent components are discussed and proposed. The work described in this paper represents the joint efforts of an integrated, energetic group at SRI. Members of this group include Rich Fikes (now at Xerox PARC), Koichi Furukawa (now at ETL). Man's use of tools shapes his environment. Man's use of tools also shapes his behavior. As technology evolves more complex tools, the impositions these tools make on their users become more stringent. Although it is difficult to reproduce strings of ten digits, we learn to do it well, because the interface to the telephone system demands it. Although it is difficult to type very fast (the standard keyboard was originally designed to allow enough time between keystrokes to keep early typewriters from jamming), we train ourselves to use a suboptimal-indeed, subaverage-arrangement of keys, because the interface to keyboard systems demands it. As the amount of information moving across the man-machine interface increases, the impositions of machines on our behavior also increase. Since computers exchange large amounts of information with their human users they place great Impositions on us. A goal of research in Artifical Intelligence is to reduce the extent of these impositions, thus making the benefits of computer use more widely available. One example of the imposition set by the computer arises in the area of management information systems. Imagine that a user in a decision-making role knows that his data base contains some information that pertains to a decision he must make. The user wishes to extract that information from the data base and restructure, summarize, or analyze it in some way.

These and the other things that cause changes in objects over time are intuitively characterized by processes. Much of formal physics consists of characterizations of processes by differential equations that describe how the parameters of objects change over time. But the notion of process is richer and more structured than this. We often reach conclusions about physical processes based on very little information. For example, we know that if we heat water in a sealed container the water can eventually boil, and if we continue to do so the container can explode. To understand commonsense physical reasoning we must understand how to reason qualitatively about processes, when they will occur, their effects, and when they will stop.

Eric L. Grimson", "Daniel P. Huttenlocher"], "date": "1990", "abstract": "Geometric Hashing is a technique for recognizing partially occluded objects from noisy data. It uses ofline preprocessing to construct a redundant representation of each object in terms of all possible transformation-invariant coordinate frames. At recognition time, every such coordinate frame specified by the image i s used to compute the possible tmnsformation-invariant representations of the image. If suficiently many of the image values are similar to those computed for one of the stored models, then a match is hypothesized. The formal description of the geometric hashing method is for noise-free data. In this paper, we present a formal model for analyzing how the method performs in the presence of sensory uncertainty. We find that while the method performs well for simple images or for exact data, the performance degrades rapidly for cluttered scenes or in the presence of even moderate sensor error (3-5 pixels). 1 Geometric Hashing for Object Recognition Geometric Hashing is a technique for model-based recognition [4, 5, 61 based on the idea of storing redundant, transformation-invariant information about an object in a hash table. At recognition time, invariants are computed from the image and used to index into the hash table to find possible matches with the model. If enough sensor invariants score a hit when hashed against the model table, one has in principle found an instance of the model in the data. A recent paper [l] significantly improves upon this basic method by explicitly modelling uncertainty in the image measurements. Reported experimental results using the geometric hashing method [5, 61 and the improved version [l] have been limited to simple scenes.

In particular, the method\u2019s performance depends critically on the ability to construct a relatively sparse hash table. With no sensor noise, it is easy to construct such a hash table. In noisy or cluttered scenes, it is unclear whether such a sparsely populated table can be constructed. Our formal analysis indicates that geometric hashing does not extend well to more difficult recognition problems. We show that for simple scenes with little sensor noise the method performs well, but for scenes with even small amounts of clutter or moderate sensory uncertainty (e.g. 5 pixels) the method will find many false matches. In such cases the hash table used to represent a model becomes quite full, causing many spurious matches to be found. 1.1 Details of the Geometric Hashing Method The basic form of Geometric Hashing [4] is summarized as follows. Objects are represented by collections of features, or interest points. A match of a model to a scene consists of a subset of the model features each of which can be mapped onto a corresponding image feature using a single transformation of some type. Geometric hashing has been used with various types of transformations, including 2D and 3D rigid body motions and affine approximations to perspective projection. Here, we consider 2D affine transformations (i.e. each image point x\u2019 is obtained from a model point x by x\u2019 = Ax + b where A is a non-singular 2 x 2 matrix, and b is a 2-vector). A similar analysis applies to the other types of transformations. The basic method has two stages: (i) construction of a model hash table and (ii) matching of the models to an image. The idea behind the hash table is that each 1-tuple of model points forms a basis for a coordinate system that is invariant under possible model transformations. Thus all model points can be stored in a transformation-invariant fashion by rewriting them in terms of this reference frame. The rewritten model points serve as indices into the hash table, where the corresponding basis 1-tuples are stored.

The ob jec t i ve of in t roducing users ' views is to keep the query language independent of the l o g i c a l s t ruc tu re of the r e l a t i o n a l data base. Assume that we have a r e l a t i o n a l data hase which consists of the fo l l ow ing base r e l a t i o n s : EMP(NAME, DNAME SAL) DEPT(WAME MGR) where the domais DNAME in EMP and NAME in DEPT are both the set of departments. Assume also that a user wants to def ine a v i r t u a l r e a l ! i o n VEMP(NAME DNAME SAL MGR). In the v i r t u a l r e l a t i o n VEMP, the domain MGR belongs to the employee r e l a t i o n , but in fact i t belongs to the department r e l a t i o n . The domain MGR is considered to have been t ransfered from the department r e l a t i o n to the employee r e l a t i o n , and we c a l l t h i s k ind of v i r t u a l domain a t r a n s i t i v e domain. in terms of the VEMP r e l a t i o n , the fac t tha t the manager of an employee i is x is expressed as VEMP.MGR(i,x). The QA system has to transform t h i s expression to the f o l l ow ing conjunct ion of l i t e r a l s on the base r e l a t i o n s : Let us consider the query \"Who is the manager of Mr. SMITH ?\" . In terms of the v i r t u a l r e l a t i o n VEMP, t h i s quest ion is l o g i c a l l y expressed by N a t u r a l L a n r u a \u00a3 0 3 : Furukawa 60 (?x)(i)(VEMP.NAME(i, 'SMITH' A VEMP.MGR(i,?x)). (2 ) By subst i tut ing the second term in (2) by the righthand expression of the equivalence sign = in ( l ) , we obtain the fol lowing expression: ( a ?x) (3 i ) (a j ) (3y) (VEMP.NAME(i,'SMITH' ) A EMP.

This type of axiom is called a simple domain axiom, and a query which does not include any v i r t u a l re la t ion l i t e r a l s is called a base query. It is obvious that any query which is specified in terras of v i r t ua l relat ions is translated to an equivalent base query by logical inference.

A Horn set is a set of clauses such that none of its members contains more than one positive literal. A strictly-unit refutation is a proof by contradiction in which no step is justified by applying a rule of inference to a set of clauses all of which contain more than one literal. Horn sets occur in many fields of mathematics such as the theory of groups, rings, Moufang loops, and Henkin models. The usual translation into first-order predicate calculus of the axioms of these and many other fields yields a set of Horn clauses. The striking feature of the Horn property for finite sets of clauses is that its presence or absence can be determined by inspection. Thus, the determination of the applicability of the theorems and procedures of this paper is immediate.\nIn Theorem 1 it is proved that, if S is an unsatisfiable Horn set, there exists a strictly-unit refutation of S employing binary resolution alone, thus eliminating the need for factoring; moreover, one of the immediate ancestors of each step of the refutation is in fact a positive unit clause. A theorem similar to Theorem 1 for paramodulation-based inference systems is proven in Theorem 3 but with the inclusion of factoring as an inference rule. In Section 3 two reduction procedures are discussed. For the first, Chang's splitting, a rule is provided to guide both the choice of clauses and the way in which to split. The second reduction procedure enables one to refute a Horn set by refuting but one of a corresponding family of simpler subproblems.", "references": ["The-Unit-Proof-and-the-Input-Proof-in-Theorem-Chang/7bf360421e1ed036e025606bc5b9c6089f8adfdb"]},

Kassirer"], "date": "1983", "abstract": "The ability to identify and represent the knowledge that a human expert has about a particular domain is a key method in the creation of expert computer system. The first part of this paper demonstrates a methodology for collecting and analysing observations of experts at work, in order to find the conceptual framework used for the particular domain. The second part develops a representation for qualitative knowledge of the structure and behavior of a mechanism. The qualitative simulation, or envisionment, process is given a qualitative structural description of a mechanism and some initialization information, and produces a detailed description of the mechanism's behavior. This \"vertical\" slice of the construction of a cognitive model demonstrator, an effective knowledge acquisition method for the purpose of determining the structure of the representation itself, not simply the content of the knowledge to be encoded in that representation. Most importantly, it demonstrates the interaction among constraints derived from the textbook knowledge of the domain, from observations of the human expert, and from the computational requirements of successful performance. 1 . I n t roduc t i on How does an expert physician reason about the way the body works? We are exploring the hypothesis that the physician has a cognitive \"causal model\" of the patient that can be used to simulate the normal working of the body, its pathological behavior in a diseased state, and the idiosyncracies that characterize a particular patient. Our goal in this paper is to demonstrate a method we have used successfully to analyze physician behavior in detail, and derive critical properties of the knowledge representation. Taking these empirical constraints along with computational constraints on knowledge representations has allowed us create a working program that simulates the reasoning processes of the physician. Research in artificial intelligence has recently begun to address the problems of causal reasoning in diagnosis, explanation, and 1.

This work has been important in identifying computational constraints on knowledge representations for causal reasoning, but in most cases it has been only loosely constrained by empirical study of the way human experts actually solve problems. Cognitive scientists such as Chi, et al [1] and Larkin, et al [11] have studied the ways that experts and novices formulate and solve word problems in physics, but without specifying the knowledge representations and implementing working computer simulations. We believe that it is important to unify these two approaches, to develop techniques for designing knowledge representations constrained by empirical observations. Our methods are designed for determining the knowledge representation of the knowledge base, even before attempting to capture large quantities of domain knowledge. 2. Design of the Exper iment Our methodology must determine constraints from human behavioi that can help us develop adequate hypotheses about the structure of knowledge representations [8]. There are two basic questions we want to answer about the behavior of an unknown knowledge representation that will aid in determining its structure: (1) What states of knowledge can be expressed? (?) What inferences can take place? A methodology of discovery appropriate to the undoubted complexity of human knowledge requires richly-structured data about individuals rather than easily analyzed data about a population. As Newell and Simon [12] point out, only the full complexity of verbal behavior, as captured in a verbatim transcript, can do justice to the complexity of the knowledge representation. Therefore, in order to study the representation of causal knowledge in physicians, we decided to analyze verbatim transcripts of a small number of physicians solving problems using their causal knowledge. Our study included subjects at three widely spaced levels of expertise: medical school faculty members (the masters), second-year residents (the journeymen), and fourth year medical students (the apprentices). The scope of this paper, however, only permits us tc discuss results from a single subject (a journeyman). The interview is designed as a \"thinking aloud\" experiment, in which the subject is asked to report as much as possible of what he thinks about as he solves a problem. This type of experiment is particularly sensitive to the natural control structure of the subject's problem solving method, but cannot support direct conclusions about the limits of the subject's knowledge. The 50 B. Kuipers and J. Kassirer \"thinking aloud\" experiment is complemented by a \"cross examination\" experiment, in which the experimenter asks probing questions about the subject's knowledge of particular topics. The \"cross examination\" interview is not sensitive to the natural control structure of the problem -solving method, but is much more effective for determining the limits of the knowledge represented, particularly in highly articulate subjects such as physicians. In a recent survey, Kassirer, Kuipers, and Gorry [0] review the methodologies for investigating clinical cognition and describe some of the pitfalls and promise of the analysis of verbatim transcripts of physicians solving realistic medical problems. Although the work of Elstein, et al (4| is important and path-breaking, Kassirer, et al [8] criticize it for its reliance on retrospective reflections of physicians when viewing videotapes of their own behavior. In an extensive review, Nisbett and Wilson (131 show that a subject has no privileged knowledge of the factors that influence his behavior Ericsson and Simon [5] develop a model of the verbalization process and use it to clarify and refine Nisbett and Wilson's conclusion They conclude that a subject's statement of what is currently in his focus of attention is unlikely to be in error. It is the subject's commonsense theory of his own cognitive processes that has no particular privileged status. The material for the interview consisted of a slightly atypical case of a kidney disorder called the nephrotic, syndrome, presented as a case summary on a single sheet of paper. Because of a self induced low-salt diet, this particular patient experienced no swelling, though all other signs and laboratory results allowed an unambiguous diagnosis to be made. The atypical case allowed us to compare throe different causal models in the same subject: the model of salt and water handling by the healthy kidney, the pathophysiology of nephrotic syndrome, and the idiosyncracies of the particular patient. 3 . The Nephro t ic S y n d r o m e The nephrotic syndrome case was selected to investigate causal reasoning about equilibrium processes which are central to physiological mechanisms. Two important equilibrium processes are disturbed in the nephrotic syndrome: the transfer of salt and water across capillary walls (the standing equilibrium) and the transfer of salt and water from the plasma into the urine. The Standing equilibrium determines the flow of water between the plasma and the tissues (the spaces between the cells), according to the balance of competing hydrostatic pressure and oncotic pressure in the plasma and in the tissues. The second important equilibrium, also controlled by the kidney, determines the total amount of salt and water in the body. If the body contains too much salt and water, the kidney excretes more of each into the urine; if there is too little, it cuts back on excretion. In the nephrotic syndrome, both of these equilibria are shifted to new stable points, keeping the body in balance but causing problems for the patient. The basic cause of nephrotic syndrome is that the kidney excretes protein that it was supposed to retain, and consequently plasma proteins are depleted. The amount of protein in the plasma determines its oncotic pressure, and hence is an important factor in the Starling equilibrium. With less protein in the blood, the Starling equilibrium shifts, moving some water from the plasma into the tissues. This movement of extra water into the tissues in itself usually causes no clinical manifestations. However, the shift of water to the tissues leaves the plasma volume low. so the kidney starts, to retain water rather than allowing it to be excreted in the urine. 1 he Starting equilibrium, of course, continues to shift much of this additional fluid into the tissues, and substantial edema (swelling, particularly in the legs) develops. From the patient's point of view, this accumulation can produce as much as fifty pounds of extra water in the legs and abdomen To understand the mechanism of edema in nephrotic syndrome requires an understanding of both equilibria and their interaction. Retention of salt by the kidney is central to the mechanism whereby the kidney retains water. In response to a contraction of plasma volume, the kidney's primary response is to retain salt. Salt retention, in turn, is what causes Water retention. The particular patient whose history formed the basis of the experiment had selected a low salt diet, so the kidney was unable to retain much salt or water, and the edema was consequently much less than a physician would expect. 4.

In developing such a system for troubleshooting digital electronics, we have argued for the importance of pathways of causal interaction as a key concept. We have also suggested using a layered set of interaction paths as a way of constraining and guiding the diagnostic process. We report here on the implementation and use of these ideas. We show how they make it possible for our system to generate a few sharply constrained hypotheses in diagnosing a bridge fault. Abstracting from this example, we find a number of interesting general principles at work. We suggest that diagnosis can be viewed as the interaction of simulation and inference and we find that the concept of locality proves to be extremely useful in understanding why bridge faults are difficult to diagnose and why multiple representations are useful. 1. ItJTRODUCTION Interest has grown recently in the development of expert systems that reason \u201cfrom first principles\u201d, i.e., from an understanding of the structure and function of the devices they are examining. This approach has been explored in a number of domains, with the \u201cdevices\u201d ranging from the gastro-intestinal tract [6], to transistors [l] and digital logic components like adders or multiplexors [3,5]. Our work has focused on the last of these, attempting to build a troubleshooter for digital electronic hardware. By reasoning from first principles, we mean the kind of skill exhibited by an engineer who can troubleshoot a device by reference to its schematics, even though he may never have seen that particular device before. To do this we require something more than a collection of empirical associations specific to a given machine. We will see that the alternative mechanism has a degree of machine independence and is revealing for what it indicates about the nature of the diagnostic process. We have previously proposed the use of a layered set of models as a mechanism for guiding diagnosis [2,3]. Here we describe the implementation of that idea and demonstrate its utility in diagnosing a bridge fault. We then abstract from this example to consider why bridge faults are difficult to diagnose and why multiple representations are useful. This results in a number of * This report describes research done at the Artificial intelligence Laboratory of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Support for the laboratory\u2019s Artificial intelligence research on electronic troubleshooting is provided in part by a grant from the Digital Equipment Corporation. observations about the nature of diagnostic reasoning and the selection and design of representations. 2. CENTRAL CONCERNS Four issues are of central concern in this paper. We describe them here briefly, enlarging on them in the remainder of the paper. jDiagnosis can be accomplished via the interaction of simulation and inference. Given knowledge of the inputs to a device and an understanding of how it is supposed to work, we can generate expectations about its intended behavior. Given observations about its outputs, we can generate conclusions about its actual behavior. Comparison of these two, in particular differences between them, provides the foundation for our troubleshooting. t Paths of causal interaction play a central role in diagnosis. An important part of the knowledge about a domain is understanding the mechanisms and pathways by which one component can affect another. We argue that such models of interaction are more fundamental than traditional fault models. t One technique for dealing with the complexity of diagnosis is layering the paths of interaction. To be good at hardware diagnosis, we need to handle many different kinds of paths of interaction. But this presents a problem: includinq all of them destroys our ability to discriminate among potential candidates, yet omitting any one of them makes it impossible to diagnose an entire class of faults. In response, we suggest the simple expedient of layering the models, using the most restrictive first and falling back on less restrictive models only in the face of contradictions. 7 The concept of locality proves to be a useful principle in both diagnosis and the selection of representations. We find that the concept of locality, or adjacency, helps to explain why bridge faults are difficult to diagnose: changes small and local in one representation are not necessarily small and local in another. We discover that locality can be defined by reference to the paths of interaction and find that the utility of multiple representations arises in part from the different definitions of locality they offer. 3. BACKGROUND If we wish to reason from knowledge of structure and behavior, we need a way of describing both. We have developed representations for each of these, described in more detail elsewhere [3,4]. We limit our description here to reviewing only those characteristics of our representations important for understanding the example in Section 4.

To overcome this 'paradox' requires multiple representations of knowledge, inferencing schemes for each, and communication schemes between them. This paper presents a program, NEWTON, applying this idea to the domain of simple classical mechanics. NEWTON employs the method of envisionment, whereby simple questions may be answered directly, and plans produced for solving more complex problems. Envisioning enables NEWTON to use qualitative arguments when possible, with resorts to mathematical equations only if the qualitative reasoning fails to produce a solution. I n t r o d u c t i o n Expert problem-solving programs have focused on working problems which humans consider difficult Charniak demonstrated the expertise of CARPS [68] by using it to solve problems from a freshman calculus text. The achievements of MACSYMA [Mathlab 74] are touted by exhibiting some complicated expressions it can integrate. There is no doubt that these two problem areas are difficult, but before we attribute expertise to these programs we should first examine the depth of their understanding of the problem areas I propose one criterion: As well as being able to solve the difficult problems, (he expert problem-solver should be able to solve simpler versions of a problem with qualitatively simpler techniques. We will see that the inability to solve simple problems is the source of many of the difficulties problem-solvers encounter in attacking harder problems. My experience teaching electrical network theory suggests that this criterion also applies to students Consider the problem of determining the average power dissipated by a network. A general technique which solves this problem is to write down Kirchoff's current law for all the nodes and solve the resulting equations. A poor student always applies this technique immediately, while the better student looks first to see whether some simplifications are possible. For example, if the network consisted of only capacitors and inductors, the poor student sti l l sets up equations while the bet'er student immediately replies zero since capacitors and inductors do not dissipate power. The reason the student who immediately sets up equations does worse, is that without first simplifying the problem the resulting equations are often unmanageable. If the topology of the network was unspecified, the poor student would be unable to even set up the equations while the better student would stilt be able to solve the problem. To determine whether an the object released at A reaches B on the roughened track requires a careful analysis of the shape and frictional properties of the track. The slightly different problem where friction is zero can be solved with the same technique. This would be a rather stupid since a simple comparison of the relative heights of A and B Knowledge Repr. 299 would solve the problem directly. The mark of an expert is that such qualitatively simpler problems are attacked by qualitatively different techniques.", "references": ["Computer-Understanding-Of-Physics-Problems-Stated-Novak/4bb87a5e74082fe18848fed416cec0954bf78593", "Will-it-Reach-the-Top-Prediction-in-the-Mechanics-Bundy/b2d3f1d5cdb5a31db76fb84734b65b87ef618421", "Analysing-Mathematical-Proofs-(Or-Reading-Between-Bundy/c0a4ac14a4126e4b124667a9312c9263212493fe"]},

They either made very global statements about how to proceed, \"First, I figured out what was h a p p e n i n g . . . then I, I started seeing how these different things were related to each o t h e r . . . I think of formulas that give their relationships and then . . . I keep on relating things through this chain . . . . \" or they\" would attempt to solve the problem, giving the detailed equation sets they would use. Features Cuing the Principles We examined the second portion of the protocols where subjects explicitly stated the features of the problems that led to their \"basic approach.\" This analysis reveals several interesting aspects that are consistent with our interpretations from earlier experiments. Table 11 shows the frequency with which problem features were cited by the two experts and two novices as salient for leading to their \"basic approach.\" A feature was included if it was mentioned at least twice (across 20 problems) by either of the two subjects, or once by both. The numbers given represent the number of problems for which each subject listed each feature as influential in his or her \"basic approach\" decision. First, as can be seen in the table, the kinds of features mentioned as relevant by the novices are different from those identified as relevant by the experts. There is essentially no overlap in the features mentioned by novices and experts except for the object \"spr ing.\" Relevant features selected by the novices are again literal objects and terms that can be identified in the problem statement, such as \"friction,\" \"gravi ty ,\" etc. Features identified by the experts can be characterized as descriptions of the states and conditions of the physical situation ,described by the problem. In some instances, these are transformed or derived features, such as a \"before and after situation\" or \"no external forces.\" Because these features are not explicitly stated in the problem, we refer to these features as second-order features. Second-order features are almost never mentioned by the novices. Since second-order features must necessarily be derived from more literal surface features that are in the problem statementsj it is of interest to see whether the surface features in the problem statement that elicit these second-order features can be identified. In order to do this, we can examine the initial part of the protocols (deciding the \"basic approach\") where second-order features were mentioned and infer the literal surface features from which these were elicited. Such inferences can be made more easily from protocols in which subjects gave responses after reading segments of the problem statement. In such cases, we can make mappings between what was read and what was said. In any case, such inferences are difficult; they must be speculative.

The goal is to recognize two-dimensional objects in a scene given a reasonably large database of known objects.

Local boundary features that constrain an object\u2019s position and orientation provide a basis for hypothesis generation. Parameter space clustering of hypotheses is used to rank hypotheses according to preliminary evidence prior to verification. This dramatically reduces the time for recognition and number of hypotheses that must be tested.

Detection of a specific structural motif within a protein (or DNA) aids in elucidating the role played by the protein (DNA element) and the mechanism of its operation. The number of crystallographically known structures at high resolution is increasing very rapidly. Yet, comparison of three-dimensional structures is a laborious time-consuming procedure that typically requires a manual phase. To date, there is no fast automated procedure for structural comparisons. We present an efficient O(n3) worst case time complexity algorithm for achieving such a goal (where n is the number of atoms in the examined structure). The method is truly three-dimensional, sequence-order-independent, and thus insensitive to gaps, insertions, or deletions. This algorithm is based on the geometric hashing paradigm, which was originally developed for object recognition problems in computer vision. It introduces an indexing approach based on transformation invariant representations and is especially geared toward efficient recognition of partial structures in rigid objects belonging to large data bases. This algorithm is suitable for quick scanning of structural data bases and will detect a recurring structural motif that is a priori unknown. The algorithm uses protein (or DNA) structures, atomic labels, and their three-dimensional coordinates. Additional information pertaining to the structure speeds the comparisons. The algorithm is straightforwardly parallelizable, and several versions of it for computer vision applications have been implemented on the massively parallel connection machine. A prototype version of the algorithm has been implemented and applied to the detection of substructures in proteins.", "references": []},

Lowe"], "date": "1987", "abstract": "The viewpoint consistency constraint requires that the locations of all object features in an image must be consistent with projection from a single viewpoint. The application of this constraint is central to the problem of achieving robust recognition, since it allows the spatial information in an image to be compared with prior knowledge of an object's shape to the full degree of available image resolution. In addition, the constraint greatly reduces the size of the search space during model-based matching by allowing a few initial matches to provide tight constraints for the locations of other model features. Unfortunately, while simple to state, this constraint has seldom been effectively applied in model-based computer vision systems. This paper reviews the history of attempts to make use of the viewpoint consistency constraint and then describes a number of new techniques for applying it to the process of model-based recognition. A method is presented for probabilistically evaluating new potential matches to extend and refine an initial viewpoint estimate. This evaluation allows the model-based verification process to proceed without the expense of backtracking or search. It will be shown that the effective application of the viewpoint consistency constraint, in conjunction with bottom-up image description based upon principles of perceptual organization, can lead to robust three-dimensional object recognition from single gray-scale images.", "references": ["Three-Dimensional-Object-Recognition-from-Single-Lowe/4ef973984a8ea481edf74e0d2074e19d0389e76b", "Turning-something-over-in-the-mind.-Cooper-Shepard/3f8183cf6b7955758acb7b29bc764e97acf3c319", "A-Parallel-Process-Model-of-Mental-Rotation-Funt/2f672e7e857f15eecf60db6d496b78274d9bf80a", "Mental-rotation%3A-a-computationally-plausible-of-Morgan/8c7160aacc22501a2959ee27344cd41f4ad28c5f"]},

The emphasis is on reliable and fast low level visual techniques which determine the existence and location of objects in the world, but do not identify them. Included are an interest operator for choosing distinctive regions in images, a correlator for finding matching regions in similar images, a camera solver which determines camera displacement and distance to objects from stereo information tGennery, D.B., this Proceedings] and an automatic geometric distortion corrector for camera nonlinearities. Many of these use pictures reduced in linear dimension by powers of 2 by summation of pixels. Other operators are a high pass filter. a point noise remover, a contrast normalizes a vertical roll corrector, a picture comparator and an operator for reducing pictures by other than powers of two. Our hardware includes an electric vehicle, called the cart, remotely controlled over a CB radio link by a PDP-KL10. It carries a b/w tv camera whose picture is broadcast over a UHF channel, and occasionally digitized by the computer. It has motors for the wheels, steering and camera pan. Each can be made to run forward or backward. There are potentiometers on the steering and pan which enables them to be commanded to point straight ahead. Budgetary and personnel limitations have resulted in crude mechanical arrangements. The motor speeds are poorly regulated, and video is the only feedback to the computer. Dead reckoning errors are about 30%. Our small resources have been spent gaining software experience before undertaking serious hardware work. In my opinion our major hardware limitation is one shared by all other vision work, and Al in general, namely a critical shortage of raw processing power. For instance it would take about 100,000 efficiently programmed PDP-10's to match the human visual system. Results Early versions of the routines described below were used in a program which drove the vehicle in straight lines or uniform arcs. It acquired and tracked distant features, using their motion from frame to frame to build up a model of vehicle response, and to servo on the desired path.

Lowe"], "date": "1987", "abstract": "A computer vision system has been implemented that can recognize threedimensional objects from unknown viewpoints in single gray-scale images. Unlike most other approaches, the recognition is accomplished without any attempt to reconstruct depth information bottom-up from the visual input. Instead, three other mechanisms are used that can bridge the gap between the two-dimensional image and knowledge of three-dimensional objects. First, a process of perceptual organization is used to form groupings and structures in the image that are likely to be invariant over a wide range of viewpoints. Second, a probabilistic ranking method is used to reduce the size of the search space during model based matching. Finally, a process of spatial correspondence brings the projections of three-dimensional models into direct correspondence with the image by solving for unknown viewpoint and model parameters. A high level of robustness in the presence of occlusion and missing data can be achieved through full application of a viewpoint consistency constraint. It is argued that similar mechanisms and constraints form the basis for recognition in human vision.

The difference between these two classes of problems is obvious; in the former case, no straightforward algorithm exists which will guarantee a solution, and indeed, an analytic form for the solution may not even exist. On the other hand, algorithms do exist for the solution of problems such as series expansion and differentiation, and therefore a correct answer may always be found provided that the researcher possesses sufficient time, perseverance, and accuracy to carry the more complicated problems through free of error. Many examples of this type of problem may be found in physics and engineering. Calculations of general relativistic effects in planetary motion, structural design calculations, and many of the calculations associated with elementary particle physics experiments at high energy accelerators, to name a few, may demand many man-months or even years of work before a useful and error free answer can be found, even though the operations involved are quite straightforward.", "references": []},

Frequently, processes are needed which reduce ambiguity and noise, and select the best label among several possible choices. Relaxation labeling processes are just such a class of algorithms. They are based on the parallel use of local constraints between labels. This paper develops a theory to characterize the goal of relaxation labeling. The theory is founded on a definition of con-sistency in labelings, extending the notion of constraint satisfaction. In certain restricted circumstances, an explicit functional exists that can be maximized to guide the search for consistent labelings. This functional is used to derive a new relaxation labeling operator. When the restrictions are not satisfied, the theory relies on variational cal-culus. It is shown that the problem of finding consistent labelings is equivalent to solving a variational inequality. A procedure nearly identical to the relaxation operator derived under restricted circum-stances serves in the more general setting. Further, a local convergence result is established for this operator. The standard relaxation labeling formulas are shown to approximate our new operator, which leads us to conjecture that successful applications of the standard methods are explainable by the theory developed here.

The focus of the research is to use these hierarchies to achieve robust recognition based on effective organization and indexing schemes for model libraries. The goal of the system is to recognize parameterized instances of non-rigid model objects contained in a large knowledge base despite the presence of noise and occlusion. Robustness is achieved by developing a system that can recognize viewed objects that are scaled or mirror-image instances of the known models or that contain component subparts with different relative scaling, rotation, or translation than in the models. The approach taken in this thesis is to develop an object shape representation that incorporates a component sub-part hierarchy-to allow for efficient and correct indexing into an automatically generated model library as well as for relative parameterization among sub-parts, and a scale hierarchy-to allow for a general to specific recognition procedure. The implemented system uses a representation based on significant contour curvature changes and a recognition engine based on geometric constraints of feature properties.

We have implemented a recognition system that uses this transformation method to determine possible alignments of a model with an image. Each of these hypothesized matches is verified by comparing the entire edge contours of the aligned object with the image edges. Using the entire edge contours for verification, rather than a few local feature points, reduces the chance of finding false matches.

In addition, the intermediate states of the computation are such that if the rotation process were to be interrupted at any point, the object representation would correspond to that of the actual object at a position along the rotation trajectory. The computational model presented here is governed by three constraining assumptions: (a) that it be parallel; (b) that the communication between processors be restricted to immediate neighbors; (c) that the object representation be distributed across a large fraction of the avai lable processors.

The fundamental assumption of the proposed theory. recognition-by-components (RBC), is that a modest set of components [N probably 5 361 can be derived from contrasts of five readily detectable properties of edges in a 2-dimensional image: curvature, collinearity, symmetry, parallelism, and cotermination. The detection of these properties is generally invariant over viewing position and image quality and consequently ;allows robust object perception when the image is projected from a novel viewpoint or degraded. RBC thus provides a principled account of the heretofore undecided relation between the classic principles of perceptual organization and pattern recognition: The constraints toward regularization (Pragnanz) characterize not the complete object but the obJect\u2019s components. Representational power derives from an allowance of free combinations of the components. A principle of componential recovery can account for the major phenomena of object recognit.on: If an arrangement of two or three primitive components can be recovered from the input, objects can be quickly recognized even when they are occluded, rotated in depth, novel, or extensively degraded. The results from experiments on the perception of briefly presented pictures by human observers provide empirical support for the theory. c 1~x5 Academic Press.

Two fundamental descriptions were independently varied in the construction of six-letter nonword strings. A probabilistic description based on the frequency of occurrence of letters in each position was factorially combined with a rule-governed description defined in terms of graphemic and phonological constraints. College sophomores and sixth-grade readers were asked to indicate whether or not a predesignated target letter was present in these strings. For both groups of readers, orthographic regularity and summed positional frequency were found to have only a small facilitative effect on reaction time (RT). In contrast, RTs to say \"no\" increased dramatically with increases in the number of letters in the catch string that were physically similar to the target letter. In another experiment, the letter string was presented for a short duration, followed immediately by masking stimulus and then the target letter. College students indicated whether or not the target was present in the test string. Accuracy of performance was critically dependent on the orthographic regularity and summed positional frequencies of the letters in the test string. No effect of letter similarity was observed. The large differences that were observed between these two tasks were accounted for in terms of the stages of processing that are critical for performance in the tasks.", "references": []},

On this view, the third (radial) dimension of cortical and thalamic structures is associated with a redundancy of circuits and functions so that reliable signal processing obtains in the presence of noisy or ambiguous stimuli. A mathematical model of simple cortical and thalamic nervous tissue is consequently developed, comprising two types of neurons (excitatory and inhibitory), homogeneously distributed in planar sheets, and interacting by way of recurrent lateral connexions. Following a discussion of certain anatomical and physiological restrictions on such interactions, numerical solutions of the relevant non-linear integro-differential equations are obtained. The results fall conveniently into three categories, each of which is postulated to correspond to a distinct type of tissue: sensory neo-cortex, archior prefrontal cortex, and thalamus. The different categories of solution are referred to as dynamical modes. The mode appropriate to thalamus involves a variety of non-linear oscillatory phenomena. That appropriate to archior prefrontal cortex is defined by the existence of spatially inhomogeneous stable steady states which retain contour information about prior stimuli. Finally, the mode appropriate to sensory neo-cortex involves active transient responses. It is shown that this particular mode reproduces some of the phenomenology of visual psychophysics, including spatial modulation transfer function determinations, certain metacontrast effects, and the spatial hysteresis phenomenon found in stereopsis.", "references": []},

Marr"], "date": "1976", "abstract": "An introduction is given to a theory of early visual information processing. The theory has been implemented, and examples are given of images at various stages of analysis. It is argued that the first step of consequence is to compute a primitive but rich description of the grey-level changes present in an image. The description is expressed in a vocabulary of kinds of intensity change (EDGE, SHADING-EDGE, EXTENDED-EDGE, LINE, BLOB etc.). Modifying parameters are bound to the elements in the description, specifying their POSITION, ORIENTATION, TERMINATION points, CONTRAST, SIZE and FUZZINESS. This description is obtained from the intensity array by fixed techniques, and it is called the primal sketch. For most images, the primal sketch is large and unwieldy. The second important step in visual information processing is to group its contents in a way that is appropriate for later recognition. From our ability to interpret drawings with little semantic content, one may infer the presence in our perceptual equipment of symbolic processes that can define \"place-tokens\" in an image in various ways, and can group them according to certain rules. Homomorphic techniques fail to account for many of these grouping phenomena, whose explanations require mechanisms of construction rather than mechanisms of detection. The necessary grouping of elements in the primal sketch may be achieved by a mechanism that has available the processes inferred from above, together with the ability to select items by first order discriminations acting on the elements' parameters. Only occasionally do these mechanisms use downward-flowing information about the contents of the particular image being processed. It is argued that \"non-attentive\" vision is in practice implemented by these grouping operations and first order discriminations acting on the primal sketch. The class of computations so obtained differs slightly from the class of second order operations on the intensity array. The extraction of a form from the primal sketch using these techniques amounts to the separation of figure from ground. It is concluded that most of the separation can be carried out by using techniques that do not depend upon the particular image in question. Therefore, figure-ground separation can normally precede the description of the shape of the extracted form. Up to this point, higher-level knowledge and purpose are brought to bear on only a few of the decisions taken during the processing. This relegates the widespread use of downward-flowing information to a later stage than is found in current machine-vision programs, and implies that such knowledge should influence the control of, rather than interfering with, the actual data-processing that is taking place lower down.", "references": []},

However, in Experiment II, where photographs of objects with high-frequency (HF) and low-frequency (LF) names were used, no difference was found between Conditions Ps(HF), Ps(LF) and Condition Pv(HF); and no difference occurred between Conditions Pd(HF), Pd(LF) and Condition Pv(LF), the latter set of conditions being associated with longer RTs than the former. This pattern of results was found with both a .25-sec and a 2-sec ISI. The results are discussed in terms of the levels of coding involved in processing information from picture stimuli. It is concluded that at least two levels are involved in matching photographs of real objects (an object-code level and a nonvisual semantic code level), while a third level may be used in matching tasks involving stylized line drawings (a picture-code level).", "references": []},

In the present investigation, the time subjects took to scan between objects in a mental image was used to infer the sorts of geometric information that images preserve. Subjects studied an open box in which five objects were suspended, and learned to imagine this display with their eyes closed. In the first experiment, subjects scanned by tracking an imaginary point moving in a straight line between the imagined objects. Scanning times increased linearly with increasing distance between objects in three dimensions. Therefore metric 3-D information must be preserved in images, and images cannot simply be 2-D \"snapshots.\" In a second experiment, subjects scanned across the image by \"sighting\" objects through an imaginary rifle sight. Here scanning times were found to increase linearly with the two-dimensional separations between objects as they appeared from the original viewing angle. Therefore metric 2-D distance information in the original perspective view must be preserved in images, and images cannot simply be 3-D \"scale-models\" that are assessed from any and all directions at once. In a third experiment, subjects mentally rotated the display 90 degrees and scanned between objects as they appeared in this new perspective view by tracking an imaginary rifle signt, as before. Scanning times increased linearly with the two-dimensional separations between objects as they would appear from the new relative viewing perspective. Therefore images can display metric 2-D distance information in a perspective view never actually experiences, so mental images cannot simply be \"snapshot plus scale model\" pairs. These results can be explained by a model in which the three-dimensional structure of objects is encoded in long-term memory in 3-D object-centered coordinate systems. When these objects are imagined, this information is then mapped onto a single 2-D \"surface display\" in which the perspective properties specific to a given viewing angle can be depicted. In a set of perceptual control experiments, subjects scanned a visible display by (a) simply moving their eyes from one object to another, (b) sweeping an imaginary rifle sight over the display, or (c) tracking an imaginary point moving from one object to another. Eye-movement times varied linearly with 2-D interobject distance, as did time to scan with an imaginary rifle sight; time to tract a point varied independently with the 3-D and 2-D interobject distances. These results are compared with the analogous image scanning results to argue that imagery and perception share some representational structures but that mental image scanning is a process distinct from eye movements or eye-movement commands.", "references": []},

The difficulty of certain mental imagery tasks is shown to depend on which of the alternative structural descriptions of an object is used, and this is interpreted as evidence that structural descriptions are an important component of mental images.

For example, they do not specify the tangent direction or curvature of an edge or the locations of tangent discontinuities. In this paper, a method is presented for describing linked edge points at a range of scales by selecting intervals of the curve and scales of smoothing that are most likely to represent the underlying structure of the scene. This multiscale analysis of curves is complementary to any multiscale detection of the original edge points. A solution is presented for the problem of shrinkage of curves during Gaussian smoothing, which has been a significant impediment to the use of smoothing for practical curve description. The curve segmentation method is based on a measure of smoothness minimizing the third derivative of Gaussian convolution. The smoothness measure is used to identify discontinuities of curve tangents simultaneously with selecting the appropriate scale of smoothing. The averaging of point locations during smoothing provides for accurate subpixel curve localization.

A model called the cascade model is presented and it is shown to be compatible with the general form of the relation between time and accuracy in speed-accuracy trade-off experiments. In the model , experimentlLlmanipulations may have either or both of two effects on a processing level: They may alter the rate of response or the asymptotic quality pf the output. The effects of such manipulations on the output of a system of proessesare described. The model is then used to reexamine, the subtraction and additive factors methods for analyzing the composition of systems of processes. The examination of the additive factors method yields particularly interesting results. Among them is the finding that factors that affect the rates of two different processes would be expected to have additive effects on reaction times under the cascade model, whereas factors that both affect the rate of the same process would tend to interact, just as in the case in which the manipulations affect the durations of discrete stages. On the other hand, factors that affect asymptotic output tend to interact whether they affect the same or different processes. In light of this observation, the conclusions drawn from several studies about the locus of perceptual and attentional effects on processing are reexamined. Finally, an outline is presented of a new method for analyzing processes in cascade. The method extends the additive factors method to an analysis of the parameters of the function relating response time and accuracy.", "references": ["A-Theory-of-Memory-Retrieval-Ratcliff/bccf38995692eae3f555e91093e31f9b0199d040", "List-length-and-the-time-course-of-recognition-in-Reed/04a8914c1c38a617332ca291271a765e76e9f8a7"]},

Dunlavay"], "date": "1975", "abstract": "Th is paper presents a small vision system created to study Minsky's theory of Frame Systems It is organized around a detailed semantic hypothetical model of the scene, which is capable of being structurally altered and adjusted to f i t the visual data. Visual data is gathered through a window, whose position is controlled by suggestions which arise from uncertain parameters of the hypothetical model Introduction Minsk y's theory of Frame Systems (3) offers strong advantages for a theory of perception, and this system attempts to study it. lt does not need to see the whole scene, but only fragments of it, and occlusion is no particular problem. At all times there is a detailed semantic model of the scene which, although it may be different from the f inal model, is at least consistent The rapport between the high-level semantic model and the low-level visual data is very close, without intervening layers of computation When a hypothesis is wrong, it is not discarded but is transformed in an orderly way into a more correct hypothesis, avoiding wasted effort. One tenet of the frame theory is that one may use dozens of different models linked in this way. The space of models that our system can propose is limited to wedges, blocks, and pairs of aligned blocks because there is no intermediate level of representation between solids and vertices that the system can sense The more shapes that get added to the repertoire, the more di f f icul t it is to f ind ways to distinguish among them on the basis of vertex appearance So a lesson for the future would be to use descriptions organized around the notions of axis and section, as originated in the work of Agin and Binford. See Holterbach (2) for a thorough discussion For a detailed account of the structure and operation of the system, see the author's forthcoming dissertation. System Outline Input data, to keep the system simple, was restricted to the isolated vertices of a hand-coded line drawing. The data is examined by a program called the fovea, which reports only vertices contained within a movable diamond-shaped window. Each reported vertex consists of a point and the directions of its rays The basic operation of the system is to take vertices, one by one, and note their correspondence with points in an internal model of the scene This process is punctuated by occasional modifications to the model to accomodate the data. Blocks appear out of nowhere, shrink and grow, sometimes split in two or turn into wedges When the system can see no more vertices, it moves its window, looking for the far corners of objects whose dimensions are yet unverified. The internal model for each block or wedge is a large actor (that is, a data object together with a procedure for accessing it) containing parameters for all of its corner points, principal directions, and dimensions It thinks of itself as a complete 3-D model of the object except that the numbers stored in its points, directions, and dimensions are those of its 2-D isometric projection Each parameter has not only its value but an authority-f lag, to record whether the value is known with any certainty or is merely default Although the block contains over a dozen different parameters, it can be adjusted as a unit due to a complex system of constraint equations for adjusting default parameters The process of matching vertices to points of each object is organized around two additional kinds of actors, vertexmatching-objects and vertex-matches Each block or wedge model contains a set of vertex-matching-objects, one for each point, which can compare a vertex to that point. If it finds a comparison, it constructs a vertex-match containing a comment about the quality or meaning of the comparison, such as \"agree\", \"stretch\" meaning the object should be stretched, \"wedge\" meaning it should be changed into a wedge, or \"cut-after* meaning it should be divided in two. Since each vertex will usually be comparable to more than one point in the scene, the best vertexmatch is chosen by sorting on the comment. The vertex-match also contains machinery to adjust or modify the model once it has been chosen If it is to make a large change in the hypothesis, it uses tabular transfer rules to guide it in setting up the parameters in the new hypothesis. It does not insist that hidden vertices or rays be invisible, and sometimes they're not, if the block is really going to be a wedge. Although space does not permit greater detail, here is an outline of the contents of each type of actor: 616 Example Perception of a Block-Pair Operation of the system in perceiving an aligned pair of blocks is portrayed in Figure I. The initial fovea placement is provided by the user Vertices are processed singly in any order. The first vertex, since there is no hypothesis to accept it, causes a new block hypothesis to be created, complete with default points, lengths, and directions The second vertex establishes its x length.

The result is the ``generalized scale space'' image of a planar curve which is invariant under rotation, uniform scaling and translation of the curve. These properties make the scale space image suitable for matching. The matching algorithm is a modification of the uniform cost algorithm and finds the lowest cost match of contours in the scale space images. It is argued that this is preferable to matching in a so-called stable scale of the curve because no such scale may exist for a given curve.

Evidence is accumulated in parallel from each probe-memory item comparison, and each comparison is modeled by a continuous random walk process. In item recognition, the decision process is self-terminating on matching comparisons and exhaustive on nonmatching comparisons. The mathematical model produces predictions about accuracy, mean reaction time, error latency, and reaction time distributions that are in good accord with experimental data. The theory is applied to four item recognition paradigms (Sternberg, prememorized list, study-test, and continuous) and to speed-accuracy paradigms; results are found to provide a basis for comparison of these paradigms.

Our .method is derived from earlier work on the theory of minimumperimeter polygonal approximations of digitized closed curves. We demonstrate the specialization of this technique to the case where the error is measured as the largest Hausdorff-Euclidean distance between the approximation and the given digitized curve. We illustrate the application of this procedure to the boundaries of the images of a lung and a rib in chest radiographs. Digital curves Piecewise linear Polygonal approximation Scan-along Data compression I. I N T R O D U C T I O N Polygonal or piecewise linear curves can often effectively represent the data in waveforms and digital images (especially the boundaries of objects in these images). Representing the data by such polygonal curves usually facilitates the extraction of numerical \"features\" for the description or classification of the given waveform or images. For example, polygonal curve representations often retain the local peaks that are important in the analysis of electrocardiograms; and they often retain the shapes of the original curves perceived by the human viewer. Earlier work on the computation of polygonal curve estimates of waveforms or silhouettes had the disadvantages of requiring multiple passes through the data, a lack of control over the peak errors, and/or a restriction to one-dimensional data. Our procedure overcomes these disadvantages. In 1972 Ramer\" ' 2) described a procedure for finding a polygonal curve whose Hausdorff-Euclidean distance from a given curve does not exceed a specified error ~. Ramer's method requires several passes through the given data in order to obtain an appropriate sequence of splits of the intervals between successive vertices of the polygonal curve. In 1974 Tomek\" ' a) described a fast procedure that finds a polygonal approximation A of a digital curve B representing a function of a single variable. The procedure computes the polygonal curve A on the fly i.e. it computes the vertices of A with a short, finite memory while restricting the peak vertical deviation of A from B. Tomek's procedure, while effective, was restricted to the approximation of functions of a single variable. C 1979 IEEE. Reprinted with permission from IEEE Computer Society Conference on Pattern Recognition and Image Processing, 6-8 August 1979, Chicago, Illinois. Tomek's method is an example of a \"scan-along\" algorithm. The scan-along process has the advantage of small finite memory and high speed. In this paper we describe a scan-along procedure that is based on a two-dimensional Hausdorff-Euclidean error metric (described in section 2), so that the procedure may be applied to digitized boundaries of images in 2-space. After specializing this error metric to 1-space, it may be applied to digitized curves representing functions of a single variable. ~gl Our procedure has the further advantage that it finds a polygonal approximation whose vertices are a subset of the given digital curve. Our method is derived from earlier work on a theory of minimum-perimeter polygonal (MPP) approximations of digital closed curves, t4'5,61 Since our approximations are polygonal curves whose vertices are a subset of the points in the given digitized curve, we refer to these approximations as rectified minimumperimeter polygons (RMPPs). 2.

These systems show how continuously fluctuating data patterns can be processed by noisy populations having finitely many excitable sites. Particular examples are found in vertebrate retina and sensory cortex, as well as certain nonneural developing tissues. After an initial period of seemingly random behavior, that is described by a finite series of iterated decisions or enhancement steps, a global consensus or asymptotic pattern is reached. This is true given any number of competing populations, any mean competition function, and any number of random factors determining interpopulation signals. Which pattern will be chosen can depend on initial data and system structure in a complicated fashion. The results demonstrate a robust design that joins together the dynamics of mass action, the geometry of interpopulation competition, and the statistics of signal generation.", "references": []},

Creutzfeldt", "H. C. Nothdurft"], "date": "1978", "abstract": "A method was developed to investigate transfer properties of neurons in the visual system using pictures of complex visual stimuli. The picture is moved over the receptive field of a neuron so that it can scan it along programmed lines. The activity of the neuron during the scanning procedure is presented in a two-dimensional dot display on scale with the original picture. By superposition of the stimulus and the transfer pattern, one can find out to which detail of a stimulus the neuron responds. Neurons in the first intracerebral relay of the visual system, the lateral geniculate body, reduce a complex stimulus, such as a photograph of a natural environment, to its contours. Cortical cells only respond to contours either of a limited or of a wider range of orientations (simple and complex cells, respectively). But the course of contours is only described by a continuous representation of these contours in the cortical map of the visual field. This is done by the simple cells, which have small receptive fields and thus a higher resolving power, whereas complex cells with their large receptive fields monitor the approximate location of a moving stimulus. The function of these two classes of neurons is discussed in terms of visual behavior, i.e., for fixation, hold, and binocular vergence movements (simple cells), and for detection of moving objects and motor command signals towards these objects (complex cells). These functions are an important condition for foveal vision which is the basis of perception in primates. An important function of orientation sensitivity of simple cells may be the binocular alignment of contours in binocular fusion and stereoscopic vision.", "references": ["Eye-Movements-and-Vision-Yarbus/b5a712dd07fa65d7ad60d6e791053c29448ecb97"]},

Hubel", "Torsten N. Wiesel"], "date": "1962", "abstract": "What chiefly distinguishes cerebral cortex from other parts of the central nervous system is the great diversity of its cell types and inter-connexions. It would be astonishing if such a structure did not profoundly modify the response patterns of fibres coming into it. In the cat's visual cortex, the receptive field arrangements of single cells suggest that there is indeed a degree of complexity far exceeding anything yet seen at lower levels in the visual system. In a previous paper we described receptive fields of single cortical cells, observing responses to spots of light shone on one or both retinas (Hubel & Wiesel, 1959). In the present work this method is used to examine receptive fields of a more complex type (Part I) and to make additional observations on binocular interaction (Part II). This approach is necessary in order to understand the behaviour of individual cells, but it fails to deal with the problem of the relationship of one cell to its neighbours. In the past, the technique of recording evoked slow waves has been used with great success in studies of functional anatomy. It was employed by Talbot & Marshall (1941) and by Thompson, Woolsey & Talbot (1950) for mapping out the visual cortex in the rabbit, cat, and monkey. Daniel & Whitteiidge (1959) have recently extended this work in the primate. Most of our present knowledge of retinotopic projections, binocular overlap, and the second visual area is based on these investigations. Yet the method of evoked potentials is valuable mainly for detecting behaviour common to large populations of neighbouring cells; it cannot differentiate functionally between areas of cortex smaller than about 1 mm2. To overcome this difficulty a method has in recent years been developed for studying cells separately or in small groups during long micro-electrode penetrations through nervous tissue. Responses are correlated with cell location by reconstructing the electrode tracks from histological material. These techniques have been applied to CAT VISUAL CORTEX 107 the somatic sensory cortex of the cat and monkey in a remarkable series of studies by Mountcastle (1957) and Powell & Mountcastle (1959). Their results show that the approach is a powerful one, capable of revealing systems of organization not hinted at by the known morphology. In Part III of the present paper we use this method in studying the functional architecture of the visual cortex.

In the present study small lesions were made in single layers or pairs of layers in the lateral geniculate body, and the striate cortex was later examined with a Fink-Heimer modiikation of the Nauta method. We hoped to correlate the laminar distribution of axon terminals in the cortex with functional differences between layers, and to demonstrate the IVth-layer mosaic anatomically. After lesions in either of the two most dorsal (parvocellular) layers, terminal degeneration was found mainly in layer IVc, with a second minor input to a narrow band in the upper part of IVa. A very few degenerating fibers ascended to layer I. In contrast, lesions in either of the two ventral (magnocellular) layers were followed by terminal degeneration confined, apparently, to IVb, or at times extending for a short distance into the upper part of IVc; no degeneration was seen in layer IVa or in layer I. After a lesion confined to a single geniculate layer, a section through the corresponding region of striate cortex showed discrete areas or bands of degeneration in layer IV, usually 0.5-1.0 mm long, separated by interbands of about the same extent in which there was no terminal degeneration. When serial sections were reconstructed to obtain a face-on view of the layer-IV mosaic, it appeared as a series of regular, parallel, alternating degeneration-rich and degenerationpoor stripes. When a geniculate lesion involved both layer VI (the most dorsal, with input from the contralateral eye) and the part of layer V directly below (ipsilateral eye), the cortical degeneration, as expected, occupied a virtually continuous strip in layer IVc and the reconstructed face-on view of this layer showed a large confluent region of degeneration. In some of the reconstructions the cortical stripes seemed highly regular; in others there was a variable amount of cross connection between stripes. The stripes varied in width from 0.25 to 0.50 mm, and width did not seem to correlate with region of retinal representation. It is concluded that the long narrow stripes of alternating left-eye and righteye input to layer IV are an anatomical counterpart of the physiologically observed oculardominance columns. Because of this segregation of inputs, cells of layer IV are almost invariably influenced by one eye only. A cell above or below layer IV will be dominated by the eye supplying the nearest IVth layer stripe, but will generally, though not always, receive a subsidiary input from the other eye, presumably by diagonal connections from the nearest stripes supplied", "references": ["Organization-of-neurons-in-the-visual-cortex%2C-area-Lund/f042b89d7561d297910929b920fcb1e22f8854a3", "Short-axon-neuronal-subsystems-in-the-visual-cortex-Valverde/0602aeadc92f1502a9b7cb9bcd428146bc2530e8", "Selective-silver-impregnation-of-degenerating-axons-Wiitanen/ddb99b7e38400dea6de263904d4440120fdce653", "Two-methods-for-selective-silver-impregnation-of-in-Fink-Heimer/597e020348bc346ca5cd439aba03714aa99a8f18", "Spatial-and-chromatic-interactions-in-the-lateral-Wiesel-Hubel/8c26269a7ab8b42d59f5d125e3d283692bd37d71", "Receptive-fields%2C-binocular-interaction-and-in-the-Hubel-Wiesel/6b4fe4aa4d66fecc7b2869569002714d91d0b3f7"]},

There were characteristic differences in area-threshold and annulus-threshold curves and shapes of responses to brief and long flashes of light, and relative differences in the nature of surround adaptation and maintained discharge rates.3. The distinction of sustained from transient units survived over a wide range of backgrounds including the two principle reorganizations of function: relative weakening of surround components at low background; Purkinje shift at high.4.

Hubel and Wiesel,' in their classical papers, differentiated three categories of cells in the cat's striate cortex. They further suggested a hierarchical model which would explain the organization of the receptive fields of each type of cell. Thus only simple cells would receive a direct excitatory input from lateral geniculate neurons (LGN), and a number of simple cells with a common optimal orientation and slightly offset receptive-field positions would then provide the excitatory input to the complex cells. Finally, different complex cells with a common preferred orientation but again with offset receptive-field positions would provide excitatory and inhibitory inputs to the hypercomplex cells. The inhibitory input to the hypercomplex cell would explain that the sharp reduction in the discharge, as an optimally oriented stimulus, is elongated beyond the excitatory region in the receptive field. If the Hubel and Wiesel model is correct, one would expect a basic similarity between the responses of complex and hypercomplex cells. However, on the basis of the organization of their receptive field, we have been able to differentiate four classes of cells in the cat's striate cortex: simple, complex, and two distinct classes of hypercomplex cells. The majority of hypercomplex cells (Fig. 1, Type 1) have responses very similar to those of simple cells and their receptive fields can be subdivided into", "references": ["Striate-neurons%3A-receptive-field-concepts.-Bishop-Henry/91d86e4cfb56c8b604b59f14760f471362b4ee9b", "Conduction-velocity-of-afferents-to-cat-visual-a-Hoffman-Stone/358ac9a79a0b53fd424150b8dd54d38ed6c2113b", "Sustained-and-transient-neurones-in-the-cat's-and-Cleland-Dubin/9afb344a5dfc0592cd31d8184a1828e100e68ef0", "Receptive-fields-and-functional-architecture-of-Hubel-Wiesel/1116467d67f475d1bd2539862f10f792032fe13b", "Receptive-Fields-and-Functional-Architecture-in-Two-Hubel-Wiesel/f70c54029c17f50914996c834930ecbfacda195f", "Receptive-fields%2C-binocular-interaction-and-in-the-Hubel-Wiesel/6b4fe4aa4d66fecc7b2869569002714d91d0b3f7"]},

The organization of the visual cortex was studied with a technique that allows one to determine the physiology and morphology of individual cells. Micro-electrodes filled with the fluorescent dye Procion yellow were used to record intracellularly from cells in area 17 of the cat. The visual receptive field of each neurone was classified as simple, complex, or hypercomplex, and the cell was then stained by the iontophoretic injection of dye.2. Fifty neurones were successfully examined in this way, and their structural features were compared to the varieties of cell types seen in Golgi preparations of area 17. The majority of simple units were stellate cells, whereas the majority of complex and hypercomplex units were pyramidal cells. Several neurones belonged to less common morphological types, such as double bouquet cells. Simple cells were concentrated in layer IV, hypercomplex cells in layer II + III, and complex cells in layers II + III, V and VI.3. Electrically inexcitable cells that had high resting potentials but no impulse activity were stained and identified as glial cells. Glial cells responded to visual stimuli with slow graded depolarizations, and many of them showed a preference for a stimulus orientation similar to the optimal orientation for adjacent neurones.4. The results show that there is a clear, but not absolute correlation between the major structural and functional classes of cells in the visual cortex.

Schiller", "Barbara L. Finlay", "S F Volman"], "date": "1976", "abstract": "Neurons in striate cortex appear to respond in a more variable manner to visual stimulation of their receptive fields than do retinal ganglion or lateral genicu-late nucleus (LGN) cells. The extent of this variability is of interest for both method-ological and theoretical reasons. Methodologically, it is valuable to know what number of samples taken over what period of time adequately assesses a cell's response characteristics. Theoretically, some light may be shed on cortical connectivity by determining the relative variability of cell subgroups and the difference in variability between responses elicited by optimal and non-optimal stimuli. We obtained a measure of response variability for 333 neurons in striate cortex and for 16 neurons in the LGN. The data were collected from 46 monkeys (Macaca mulatta) in the standard acute preparation; they were paralyzed with Flaxedil and were artificially respired with 30 ~ O~-70 ~ N20. Only cells with receptive fields 2-5 \u00b0 from the fovea are included in this sample. The data collection and stimulus presentation system capable of producing visual stimuli in random order has been described elsewhere 5. Variability data were collected over the 3-4 rain period when the best orientation or length of an edge or bar was being assessed by sweeping a stimulus of optimal velocity across the receptive field using a waveform generator and a mirror galvanometer. All the impulses elicited during this sweep, which was typically 1 sec in duration per trial, were counted as the response. To obtain an index of variability the standard deviation of the response to 10 repeated presentations of a given stimulus was divided by the mean response and multiplied by 100. Low values indicate a cell with consistent responses and hence low variability; high values show high variability. Using a stimulus of optimal orientation, length, and velocity, the average index of variability for all units was 35.2 with a standard deviation of 20. Breakdowns of variability for simple (S-type) and complex (CX-type) cell groups appear in Fig. 1A. S-type cells are those oriented units which show spatially separated contrast specific subfields; CX-type cells are those oriented units which throughout their receptive fields respond to both light increment and light decrement 5.

The second approach, however, enables systematic analysis of the influence of various environments and test situations on behavior of the species. The existence of interactions between variables does not imply that general statements cannot be made about genetic , age, or environmental factors per se. Significant main effects may still be the primary concern of the investigator and may frequently emerge. The value of such results increases considerably, however, if it is known that the effect occurs over a wide range of conditions and if the investigator is aware of specific interactions. How is symbolic information retrieved from recent memory? The study of short-term memory (1) has revealed some of the determinants of failures to remember, but has provided little insight into error-free performance and the retrieval processes that underlie it. One reason for the neglect of retrieval mechanisms may be the implicit assumption that a short time after several items have been memorized, they can be immediately and simultaneously available for expression in recall or in other responses, rather than having to be retrieved first. In another vocabulary (2), this is to assume the equivalence of the \"span of immediate mem-ory\" (the number of items that can be recalled without error) and the \"mo-mentary capacity of consciousness\" (the number of items immediately available). The experiments reported here (3) show that the assumption is unwarranted. Underlying the paradigm of these experiments is the supposition that if the selection of a response requires the use of information that is in memory, the latency of the response will reveal something about the process by which 652 References and Notes 1. 6.

Most units responded either feebly or not at all to stimulation of the retina with diffuse light, but gave brisk responses to stationary or moving restricted spots of light. Responses to moving spots often varied with the direction of movement. It was clear that such responses must be the result of complex integrative mechanisms. The present study was undertaken to find out whether similar responses occur in retinal ganglion cells or cells of the dorsal lateral geniculate body. Lateral geniculate units have not previously been studied with restricted light stimulation, and although the cat's retinal ganglion cell has been extensively investigated by Kuffler and his co-workers (Kuffler, 1953; iKuffler, FitzHugh & Barlow, 1957), responses to moving spots were not examined. Thus it has not been possible to say whether the complex activity of cortical units originates in the cortex itself, or at lower levels.

Patterns of light stimuli most effective in influencing units at one level may no longer be the most effective at the next. From differences in responses at successive stages in the pathway one may hope to gain some understanding of the part each stage plays in visual perception. By shining small spots of light on the light-adapted cat retina Kuffler (1953) showed that ganglion cells have concentric receptive fields, with an 'on' centre and an 'off ' periphery, or vice versa. The 'on' and 'off' areas within a receptive field were found to be mutually antagonistic, and a spot restricted to the centre of the field was more effective than one covering the whole receptive field (Barlow, FitzHugh & Kuffler, 1957). In the freely moving lightadapted cat it was found that the great majority of cortical cells studied gave little or no response to light stimuli covering most of the animal's visual field, whereas small spots shone in a restricted retinal region often evoked brisk responses (Hubel, 1959). A moving spot of light often produced stronger responses than a stationary one, and sometimes a moving spot gave more activation for one direction than for the opposite. The present investigation, made in acute preparations, includes a study of receptive fields of cells in the cat's striate cortex. Receptive fields of the cells considered in this paper were divided into separate excitatory and inhibitory ('on' and 'off') areas. In this respect they resembled retinal ganglion-cell receptive fields. However, the shape and arrangement of excitatory and inhibitory areas differed strikingly from the concentric pattern found in retinal ganglion cells.

Hubel", "Torsten N. Wiesel"], "date": "1968", "abstract": "1. The striate cortex was studied in lightly anaesthetized macaque and spider monkeys by recording extracellularly from single units and stimulating the retinas with spots or patterns of light. Most cells can be categorized as simple, complex, or hypercomplex, with response properties very similar to those previously described in the cat. On the average, however, receptive fields are smaller, and there is a greater sensitivity to changes in stimulus orientation. A small proportion of the cells are colour coded.2. Evidence is presented for at least two independent systems of columns extending vertically from surface to white matter. Columns of the first type contain cells with common receptive-field orientations. They are similar to the orientation columns described in the cat, but are probably smaller in cross-sectional area. In the second system cells are aggregated into columns according to eye preference. The ocular dominance columns are larger than the orientation columns, and the two sets of boundaries seem to be independent.3. There is a tendency for cells to be grouped according to symmetry of responses to movement; in some regions the cells respond equally well to the two opposite directions of movement of a line, but other regions contain a mixture of cells favouring one direction and cells favouring the other.4. A horizontal organization corresponding to the cortical layering can also be discerned. The upper layers (II and the upper two-thirds of III) contain complex and hypercomplex cells, but simple cells are virtually absent. The cells are mostly binocularly driven. Simple cells are found deep in layer III, and in IV A and IV B. In layer IV B they form a large proportion of the population, whereas complex cells are rare. In layers IV A and IV B one finds units lacking orientation specificity; it is not clear whether these are cell bodies or axons of geniculate cells. In layer IV most cells are driven by one eye only; this layer consists of a mosaic with cells of some regions responding to one eye only, those of other regions responding to the other eye.

In the vertical system (in which cells lying along a vertical line in the cortex have common features) stimulus dimensions such as retinal position, line orientation, ocular dominance, and perhaps directionality of movement, are mapped in sets of superimposed but independent mosaics.

In higher mammals little is known about the degree to which nerve cells are specialized for handling these types of information. In a visual stimulus the importance of spatial attributes, and especially of dark-light contours, first became obvious with the discovery by Hartline (20 ) of lateral inhibition in the Limulus, a type of study that was extended to mammals when Kuffler (28) demonstrated t,hat the receptive fields of retinal ganglion cells in the cat are subdivided into a center and an opponent surround. The opponent principle, in which spatially separated excitatory and inhibitory regions are pitted against each other, has now been observed for retinal ganglion cells in the frog (1), the lizard (9), the rabbit (3), the rat (4), the ground squirrel (33), and the monkey (24). Similar effects have been seen in the lateral genie ulate bod .y and visual cortex in the cat (23, 25, 26), and also recently at these levels in the monkey. In 1958 De Valois and his collaborators (15) observed geniculate cells in the macaque monkey that were excited by one set of wavelengths and inhibited by another, making it apparent that in higher mammals the spectral composition of the stimulus was also an important variable. Similar opponent-color effects have since been described in the primate at the level of the retin .a1 ganglion cell (24), and in the visual cortex (34). I n the cat the absence or rarity of oppon .ent-color mecha nisms (19, 36 > may be related to an inferior ability to discriminate color (31, 32, 40); indeed since Svaetichin\u2019s (41) original observation of opponent-color responses in the fish retina (Spotentials), similar response patterns have been seen only in animals thought to have good color vision. Given the existence of two opponent mechanisms system, one for the spatial variable and the other for in the monkey visual color, it is natural to ask whether these occupy the same channels, or are confined to separate groups of cells.

Ablation studies have shown that destruction of superior colliculi interferes with spatial orientation and eye movement (Z-29), although the evidence regarding the effects of such lesions in primates is conflicting (1, 7, 17, 18; and unpublished observations). Stimulation studies have disclosed that electrical or chemical stimulation of the superior colliculus elicits eye and head movement in several species (4, 1 I, 20, 22). While most single-unit studies centered on the visual information-processing role of the mammalian superior colliculi (12-16, 30, 32, 33; M. Cynader and N.

We wished to assess both the visual receptivefield characteristics of units and the possible relation of unit discharges to eye movement. To carry out this plan one eye of each monkey was immobilized prior to the experiment by transection of the 3rd, 4th, and 6th cranial nerves.

The process, which is called 'k-means,' appears to give partitions which are reasonably efficient in the sense of within-class variance. That is, if p is the probability mass function for the population, S = {S1, S2, * *, Sk} is a partition of EN, and ui, i = 1, 2, * , k, is the conditional mean of p over the set Si, then W2(S) = ff=ISi f z u42 dp(z) tends to be low for the partitions S generated by the method. We say 'tends to be low,' primarily because of intuitive considerations, corroborated to some extent by mathematical analysis and practical computational experience. Also, the k-means procedure is easily programmed and is computationally economical, so that it is feasible to process very large samples on a digital computer. Possible applications include methods for similarity grouping, nonlinear prediction, approximating multivariate distributions, and nonparametric tests for independence among several variables. In addition to suggesting practical classification methods, the study of k-means has proved to be theoretically interesting. The k-means concept represents a generalization of the ordinary sample mean, and one is naturally led to study the pertinent asymptotic behavior, the object being to establish some sort of law of large numbers for the k-means. This problem is sufficiently interesting, in fact, for us to devote a good portion of this paper to it. The k-means are defined in section 2.1, and the main results which have been obtained on the asymptotic behavior are given there. The rest of section 2 is devoted to the proofs of these results. Section 3 describes several specific possible applications, and reports some preliminary results from computer experiments conducted to explore the possibilities inherent in the k-means idea.

Kidd", "Robert H. Wolfe"], "date": "1976", "abstract": "A technique i s presented for constructing a mathematical model of an Earth resources remote sensor. The technique combines established models of electronic and optical components with formulated models of scan and vibration effects, and it includes a model of the radiation effects of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. The resulting composite model is useful for predicting in-flight sensor performance, and a descriptive set of performance parameters is derived in terms of the model. A method is outlined for validating the model for each sensor of interest. The validation for one airborne infrared scanning system is accomplished in part by a satisfactory comparison of predicted response with laboratory data for that sensor. Introduction Multispectral scanning systems are used to gather remotely sensed radiometric data for a wide variety of applications, e.g., pollution monitoring, geological and urban surveying, and crop classification [ 1 31. The measure of performance of such a system can be expressed in terms of its image-resolving capability and its radiometric accuracy. The former measures the system\u2019s capability to discern a scene from imposed noise, and the latter expresses the accuracy to which the system measures the radiant power from the scene. These performance parameters are critical in assessing the usefulness of a particular system for a particular remote sensing program, and they are instrumental in determining the design requirements of an advanced sensor system. The desired performance parameters are generally not measured directly, and they must be inferred by mathematical analysis from more direct laboratory measurements and manufacturer\u2019s specifications. Such a performance evaluation of existing systems or the development of design requirements for an advanced system can be carried out in a systematic way by constructing a mathematical model of the sensor system, component by component, where each component model is parametrized by performance values obtainable from laboratory measurements or design specifications. The purpose of this paper is to develop a linear systems approach to mathematically model a typical remote sensor configuration and to predict system Performance characteristics. This approach, which treats the remote sensor as a communication system, has been used extensively to model electronic systems, as described by Papoulis [4]. The theory has been extended to optical imaging systems by Goodman [ 5 ] . Thus, this paper applies the combined optical and electronic systems theories to provide an end-to-end model of the sensor system. In addition to the sensor component characteristics, atmospheric effects are considered. The discussion is opened with a description of the sensor configuration to be modeled. Next, the mathematical models of the atmosphere and individual system components are developed, and these models are combined to provide the total system model. The components are assumed to be linear, invariant systems, and their models are expressed in terms of transfer functions. The prediction of overall system capability is derived in terms of the transfer functions and system noise characteristics. Finally, the procedure for validating the model with test data is outlined and applied to available laboratory tests for an infrared sensor used in the NASA Earth resources aircraft program. Typical sensor system The sensor system considered measures, in a number of spectral bands, the solar radiation reflected from or the thermal radiation emitted by the ground. The general spectral characteristics of the received radiation are illustrated in Fig. l for an orbital sensor viewing 300-K ground with 20 percent reflectivity [6]. These characteristics are representative of airborne sensors as well. Typically, a number of narrow spectral bands are utilized in the 0.4 pm to 2 pm wavelength region (from ultraviolet, through visible, to near infrared, respectively), and one or two bands are defined for the thermal infrared region from 8 pm to 14 pm, as shown in Fig. 1 . 29 JANUARY 1976 REMOTE SENSOR MODELING", "references": []},

Ryan Wagner", "E. F. Macnichol", "Myron L. Wolbarsht"], "date": "1960", "abstract": "A cross-section of any vertebrate retina shows a complex pattern in which many types of cells are interconnected. The functions of very few of these cell types are known in any detail. The rods and cones almost certainly absorb the light quanta and are responsible for the initiation of the train of events which culminates in the nerve impulse patterns of the ganglion cells whose axons form the optic nerve. This pat tern of nerve impulses is modified by the intensity, shape, and duration of the illumination falling on the retina. In a few types of vertebrate eyes it is also certain that the color of the stimulating light must modify the response patterns of different ganglion cells in a differential fashion. This is a requirement in any system of color vision, and it is fairly certain from behavioral experiments that these animals are able to distinguish colors. Many species of fish apparently can be trained to recognize colors. For this reason the fish retina is an appropriate place to find out how color information is encoded for transmission along the optic nerve. The response patterns of single ganglion cells of the vertebrate retina have been the subject of extensive study since Hartline's successful isolation of the ganglion cells of the frog retina. These response patterns were classified by Hartl ine (1938) into \"on ,\" \"off,\" and \"on-off ' ' types according to the temporal relationship of the discharge to the illumination. These descriptive terms have been generally accepted by subsequent investigators and are in wide usage today. The response patterns of ganglion cells of a wide variety of other vertebrates have been examined by subsequent investigators. This work has indicated that the discharge patterns are basically similar. The \"on-off ' ' type is most frequently seen and is looked on as playing the dominant role in the functional organization.

The experimental results reported here clarify some of these differences, and narrow the range of tenable hypotheses concerning the roles of subcortical visual pathways in functional recovery from cortical and midbrain tectal lesions. Lesions of superior colliculus or visual cortex in the adult Syrian golden hamster (Mesocricetus auratus) have clearly distinguishable consequences in visually guided behavior [SCHNEIDER, 1966, 1967, 1969]. To human observers, who spend much of their time looking at the behavior of fellow primates, the hamster is not an ovenvhelmingly visual animal, but he is more obviously visual than the laboratory rat and has a superior colliculus more accessible to a direct surgical approach [SCHNEIDER, 1966]. Moreover, the hamster's colliculus is about as large in surface area as area 17 of the neocortex; and the superficial gray layer of the colliculus, throughout which optic tract terminals are found, has a volume more than twice as great as that of the dorsal nucleus of the lateral geniculate body (unpublished data).", "references": ["Experience-and-vision-of-the-posterior-rat.-Bland-Cooper/21dc21f97275b11383c6daabb3167b766dc9ea07", "Evolution-of-neocortex.-Diamond-Hall/5b943f9b2ca96d8a5d244b69df5aa78fbca0e90d", "Extrageniculostriate-vision-in-the-monkey%3A-of-Pasik-Pasik/ee29b6ffb9b20f3000a0612898d22ac500825ec8", "Neuronal-plasticity-in-the-septal-nuclei-of-the-Raisman/24aeae7e268eabdf38dd597a2d8444f39164e981", "Pattern-discrimination-following-removal-of-visual-Spear-Braun/4300ca7af67111c06605c85091fc5f8437b85b88", "Posterior-neodecortication-in-the-rat%3A-age-at-and-Bland-Cooper/98f5a7a31c64b855f67e3ad5e821ec6278bbcc8b", "The-superior-colliculus-and-higher-visual-functions-Anderson-Symmes/7befab8cdb680017317d731398496c22f7474bfa", "Effects-of-subcortical-lesions-on-brightness-by-Horel/0af0140f6f47909b761838c3905f2727bcd31583"]},

De Valois"], "date": "1960", "abstract": "The monkey, Macaca mulatta, was chosen as the experimental animal for the investigation of the physiological mechanisms of color vision for two reasons: there is excellent behavioral evidence that the rhesus monkey has color vision (this is not true for some of the animals which have been used in similar investigations); furthermore, its color vision system is undoubtedly very similar to, if not identical with, that of man. There is good evidence (Walls, 1942) that color vision systems have evolved several separate times, once in the insects, again in fish, reptiles, and birds, and still again within the primate order. If this is correct, it would be little more than a coincidence ff the way in which information about the wavelength of light is encoded in the visual system of monkey and man were the same as the manner in which it is accomplished in fish or birds. In any case, if one is interested in relating the ways in which various neural elements respond to different wavelengths of light under various conditions to the manner in which these lights are perceived, one cannot go wrong in studying an animal as similar as possible to man, for virtually all of the behavioral results from color discrimination have been obtained on the human observer. The macaque lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), from which most of the recordings have been obtained, consists of six layers of cells separated by fiber layers. These cells receive connections from the axons of the ganglion cells of the retina and are thus the fourth-order neurons in the visual pathway. Anatomical studies (Glees and Le Gros Clark, 1941) have given little evidence for interconnections at this level; the types of responses recorded here may well be essentially the same as one would obtain from ganglion cells in the retina. However, the highly laminated structure of the LGN, in which the optic projection from each eye splits three ways, presents the possibility of some clues being present as to the nature of the organization of the visual system in the differential responses of cells in the various laminae. For this, as well as for certain technical reasons, the L G N rather than the retina was chosen as the recording site.", "references": ["Kinetics-of-cone-pigments-measured-objectively-on-Rushton/eddc701be8ac6e64f0d6d65fba5b2537a35a691f", "Retinal-mechanisms-for-chromatic-and-achromatic-Svaetichin-Macnichol/f458a89b3a7da0197458bf0efbb74d459e5cbfde", "Electrical-responses-of-primate-visual-system.-I.-Valois-Smith/01a9e0b0e409a6bd81c21a32b18c087482b55fa0", "An-opponent-process-theory-of-color-vision.-Hurvich-Jameson/51c840deb135375b01e72ca4847aa8929d368abe"]},

An obvious way of extending this work would be to examine electrophysiologically the functional effects of visual deprivation, but such experiments require some knowledge of normal function. During the last 10 years single-cell responses have been examined and receptive-field arrangements compared at several levels in the cat\u2019s visual pathway: in the retina (Zl), the lateral geniculate body (18), and the visual cortex (17, 19).

The most effective stimulus shapes are long narrow rectangles of light ('slits'), dark bars against a light background ('dark bars'), and straight-line borders separating areas of different brightness ('edges'). A given cell responds vigorously when an appropriate stimulus is shone on the receptive field or moved across it, provided the stimulus is presented in a specific orientation. This orientation is termed the 'receptive-field axis orientation'. It is critical, and constant for any particular cell, but may differ for different cells. The visual cortex is subdivided into discrete regions or columns extending from surface to white matter, in which all cells have the same receptivefield axis orientation (Hubel & Wiesel, 1962). The present experiments were undertaken with the object of learning more about the anatomical configuration of the columns. We wished to have a clearer idea of their shape, especially if the walls of a column were, as previous work suggested, parallel to the radial fibre bundles of the cortex and perpendicular to the cortical layers, and whether the columns were uniform or irregular in their cross-sectional shape and size. Furthermore, we were curious to know if there was any relationship between the receptive-field axis orientations of neighbouring columns, or whether, on the contrary, the different columns were intermixed in a random way throughout the cortex. These questions were approached: (1) by making several deep, closely spaced, parallel micro-electrode penetrations, placing electrolytic lesions at every shift in receptive-field orientation, and(2) by making many short penetrations in a small cortical area, noting the axis orientation of cells lying in the upper one or two layers of cortex.", "references": ["Receptive-fields%2C-binocular-interaction-and-in-the-Hubel-Wiesel/6b4fe4aa4d66fecc7b2869569002714d91d0b3f7", "Receptive-fields-of-optic-nerve-fibres-in-the-Hubel-Wiesel/b0b13465c36789ebd0751178c5403efd4dd390b9", "Modality-and-topographic-properties-of-single-of-Mountcastle/25da3e1aa66df347c0ef3bf90d00543e091a9b8d", "Chamber-for-microelectrode-studies-in-the-cerebral-Davies/1a514336509281e43e27925603a37901fd72334f"]},

Hurvich", "D. Jameson"], "date": "1957", "abstract": "The two major theoretical accounts of color vision are those classified as the Young-Helmholtz and the Hering types of theories. For many years the former has been judged by most workers in the field to provide the simplest explanation of the way in which light stimuli give rise to color sensations. The advantages that appear to favor the Young-Helmholtz three-component hypothesis are two: it is parsimonious, and its postulates are easily quantifiable and hence subject to precise experimental test. In its parsimonious and easily quantifiable form, the theory is simple: in addition to the rods which subserve twilight vision, the eye contains three kinds of cone photoreceptors; each type of cone contains a differently selective photochemical substance; each is associated with its own specific nerve fiber; and each cone-photochemical-nerve fiber system is correlated with one of the three specific \"fundamental\" color sensations, namely, red, green, and blue (or violet). All sensations are considered as compounded of varying amounts of these three excitatory systems, with white arising from equal and simultaneous excitation of all three, and yellow from equal red and green excitations. The Young-Helmholtz three-cone, three-nerve, three-sensation theory derives directly from the basic fact of color mixture, namely, that all visible hues can be matched by the mixture, in proper proportions, of only three physical light stimuli. Based squarely on this fact, the theory is readily quantified in terms of the three measurable variables of color mixture experiments. But the three measured variables, it 1 Now at New York University. must be emphasized, are the three physical light stimuli used in the color mixture experiments; they are not the postulated three \"fundamental\" color sensations, for with each different stimulus triad used for color matching a different and equally valid triad of color mixture functions is obtained. Consequently, throughout some hundred years since the original formulation of the idea, a continued series of attempts has been made to find the proper transformation of the three measured colormixture curves that will bridge the gap and yield the unique spectral distribution curves of the desired physiological correlates of the three postulated \"fundamental\" color sensations. An infinity of such transformations is available for trial, and almost every serious adherent of the theory has proposed at least one new set of \"fundamental sensation curves\" (48, pp. 368-372). The search, however, continues, because serious defects have been found in every proposal made thus far. When the explanatory or predictive power of the theory in any given quantified form is tested it cannot handle more than a limited number of facts satisfactorily (11, p. 805). Moreover, some facts of color experience seem unassimilable into the framework of the simple Young-Helmholtz theory with its three independent, fundamental, process-sensation systems.

Garey", "Edward G. Jones", "Thomas S. Powell"], "date": "1968", "abstract": "Several recent studies have indicated that the optic tectum or superior colliculus may serve more important and diverse functions than was formerly considered (Denny-Brown, 1962; Sprague and Meikle, 1965) and there is also evidence that the cortical connexions of the colliculus are significant in such functions (Sprague, 1966a, b). It has been established for some time that the superior colliculus receives a substantial projection from the neocortex (Meikle and Sprague, 1964), but relatively little attention has been paid to the organization that may be present in this system. The finding in the avian brain of a precise relationship between the representation of the retina upon the optic tectum and the origin of one group of tectal efferents (McGill, Powell, and Cowan, 1966), taken together with the well-ordered representation of the retina upon raises the question whether a comparably close relationship might not be present in the termination of the two distinct groups of afferents to the superior colliculus from the visual pathway-from the retina and from the visual cortex. As the architectonic subdivisions of the visual cortex (Otsuka and Hassler, 1962) have been shown to be functionally different (Hubel and Wiesel, 1965), and because there are separate representations of the retina in these areas, there is also the possibility that each of these areas projects independently upon the colliculus. A further aspect of the projection of the neocortex upon the tectum that should be considered is the relationship of the origin of those cortico-tectal fibres from 'non-visual' parts of the cortex to such functional areas as the auditory and somatic sensory areas and the motor cortex, and also the relationship of the termination of these fibres to that of the afferent fibres to the superior colliculus from ascending sensory pathways. The present investigation has been mainly concerned with these problems of the projection of the neocortex upon the superior colliculus in the cat (Garey, 1965), but as our material has also provided evidence on the cortical and other subcortical connexions of the visual area, certain of these findings have been included here because of their close interrelationship. The experimental results are presented and discussed in three sections, and the possible significance of these and other recent findings in the thalamocortical and mesencephalic connexions of the visual system will be finally considered in relation to the function of the superior colliculus.

Ryan Wagner", "Floyd Ratliff"], "date": "1956", "abstract": "In the compound lateral eye of Limulus each ommatidium functions as a single receptor unit in the discharge of impulses in the optic nerve. Impulses originate in the eccentric cell of each ommatidium and are conducted in its axon, which runs without interruption through an extensive plexus of nerve fibers to become a fiber of the optic nerve. The plexus makes interconnections among the ommatidia, but its exact organization is not understood. The ability of an ommatidium to discharge impulses in the axon of its eccentric cell is reduced by illumination of other ommatidia in its neighborhood: the threshold to light is raised, the number of impulses discharged in response to a suprathreshold flash of light is diminished, and the frequency with which impulses are discharged during steady illumination is decreased. Also, the activity that can be elicited under certain conditions when an ommatidium is in darkness can be inhibited similarly. There is no evidence for the spread of excitatory influences in the eye of Limulus. The inhibitory influence exerted upon an ommatidium that is discharging impulses at a steady rate begins, shortly after the onset of the illumination on neighboring ommatidia, with a sudden deep minimum in the frequency of discharge. After partial recovery, the frequency is maintained at a depressed level until the illumination on the neighboring receptors is turned off, following which there is prompt, though not instantaneous recovery to the original frequency. The inhibition is exerted directly upon the sensitive structure within the ommatidium: it has been observed when the impulses were recorded by a microelectrode thrust into an ommatidium, as well as when they were recorded more proximally in single fibers dissected from the optic nerve. Receptor units of the eye often inhibit one another mutually. This has been observed by recording the activity of two optic nerve fibers simultaneously. The mediation of the inhibitory influence appears to depend upon the integrity of nervous interconnections in the plexus: cutting the lateral connections to an ommatidium abolishes the inhibition exerted upon it. The nature of the influence that is mediated by the plexus and the mechanism whereby it exerts its inhibitory action on the receptor units are not known. The depression of the frequency of the discharge of nerve impulses from an ommatidium increases approximately linearly with the logarithm of the intensity of illumination on receptors in its vicinity. Inhibition of the discharge from an ommatidium is greater the larger the area of the eye illuminated in its vicinity. However, equal increments of area become less effective as the total area is increased. The response of an ommatidium is most effectively inhibited by the illumination of ommatidia that are close to it; the effectiveness diminishes with increasing distance, but may extend for several millimeters. Illumination of a fixed region of the eye at constant intensity produces a depression of the frequency of discharge of impulses from a nearby ommatidium that is approximately constant, irrespective of the level of excitation of the ommatidium. The inhibitory interaction in the eye of Limulus is an integrative process that is important in determining the patterns of nervous activity in the visual system. It is analogous to the inhibitory component of the interaction that takes place in the vertebrate retina. Inhibitory interaction results in the exaggeration of differences in sensory activity from different regions of the eye illuminated at different intensities, thus enhancing visual contrast.", "references": ["Spatial-Summation-of-Inhibitory-Influences-in-the-Hartline-Ratliff/5f655c2beb01bbed08908f8bffe776879a93e4bb", "Directional-Sensitivity-of-Single-Ommatidia-in-the-Waterman/f42e7b6954fbcbcfea40b04979afe8d1f84d436e", "Discharge-patterns-and-functional-organization-of-Kuffler/d11cf80190fcef83ac52086ee44876fda7507dfa", "Summation-and-inhibition-in-the-frog's-retina.-Barlow/5d977ee72fd0aaf8c2ac2808c9dd522cdef8b4b7", "Aspects-of-excitation-and-inhibition-in-the-retina.-Granit/3bf99aba831eedad3d968b0fc22aaf673591c3f3", "The-peripheral-origin-of-nervous-activity-in-the-Hartline-Wagner/69cd467212c1c3a5a3098afda659d5db6bf743cb"]},

This suggests that the anatomical connections between retina and striate cortex are for the most part innate. During the first 3 months of life the connections are highly susceptible to the effects of visual deprivation, to the extent that exclusion of all form and some light from one eye leads to a severe decline in the ability of that eye to influence cortical cells. Anatomical and physiological evidence suggests that the defect is chiefly, though not entirely, a cortical one (7-9). The object of the present study was to influence cortical connections by some means less drastic than covering one or both eyes. We wished if possible to alter the input in such a way that there would be no question of effects on the visual pathway below the level of the striate cortex. A method was suggested by the well-known clinical observation that a child with a squint (strabismus or nonparallel visual axes) may suffer a deterioration of vision in one eye (amblyopia ex anopsia). Since the visual pathways from the two eyes are for practical purposes separate up to the level of the striate cortex, it is unlikely that in these children the defect is in the retina or geniculate. An artificial squint therefore seemed to provide a possible means of obtaining a cortical defect while sparing the retina and lateral geniculate body. Accordingly , we produced a divergent strabismus by cutting one of the extraocular muscles in each of four newborn kittens, with the plan of testing vision and recording from single cortical cells after several months to a year. When at length each eye was tested in these kittens by observing the ani-mal's behavior with the other eye covered the results were disappointing: there was not the slightest suggestion of any defect in vision in either eye. This was not entirely unexpected, since with both eyes uncovered the animals had appeared to fix at times with one eye and at times with the other. At this stage there seemed to be little point in proceeding further, for there- .", "references": ["Extent-of-recovery-from-the-effects-of-visual-in-Wiesel-Hubel/c2b6bfadb13898d530e7027c2e91849997a26662", "Receptive-Fields-and-Functional-Architecture-in-Two-Hubel-Wiesel/f70c54029c17f50914996c834930ecbfacda195f", "Effects-of-Visual-Deprivation-on-Morphology-and-of-Wiesel-Hubel/30fe0e0ce84a94434e739c3952596c156ded9bcc", "Shape-and-arrangement-of-columns-in-cat's-striate-Hubel-Wiesel/d7fb932bca642615fcbcf3f5d26b2c26666603d3", "Single-cell-Responses-in-Striate-Cortex-of-Kittens-Wiesel-Hubel/2cc9381734376a5b5e309409b230c3bf753a9fd4", "Receptive-fields%2C-binocular-interaction-and-in-the-Hubel-Wiesel/6b4fe4aa4d66fecc7b2869569002714d91d0b3f7"]},

If two groups of receptors are illuminated together the total inhibition they exert on a \"test receptor\" near them (decrease in the frequency of its nerve impulse discharge in response to light) depends on the combined inhibitory influences exerted by the two groups. If the two groups are widely separated in the eye, their total inhibitory effect on the test receptor equals the sum of the inhibitory effects they each produce separately. If they are close enough together to interact, their effect when acting together is usually less than the sum of their separate effects, since each group inhibits the activity of the other and hence reduces its inhibitory influence. However, the test receptor, or a small group illuminated with it, may interact with the two groups and affect the net inhibitory action. A variety of quantitative effects have been observed for different configurations of three such groups of receptors. The activity of a population of n interacting elements is described by a set of n simultaneous equations, linear in the frequencies of the receptor elements involved. Applied to three interacting receptors or receptor groups equations are derived that account quantitatively for the variety of effects observed in the various experimental configurations of retinal illumination used.", "references": ["Inhibitory-Interaction-of-Receptor-Units-in-the-Eye-Hartline-Ratliff/46475ba5e2d1bcfce0a56a2943ae6a55be6edf8a"]},

The text i s English language text appearing in scientific and technical documents. The picture sources are the largely schematic pictures that occur in the same class of documents. However, the discussion is broadened slightly to include other picture sources. For a tiny fragment of English, the paper shows how the syntactic structure of text may be described, and then goes on to suggest that a similar analysis may be performed on the class of pictures under study. The description of these two kinds of information sources with a single class of descriptive techniques i s suggested as an alternative to the synthetic approach in which artificial languages are specified and then learned and used. The major reason for doing syntactical analysis of such sources discussed here i s that several information processing operations, amounting to the interpretation of the information sources looked upon as languages, can be done by the technique of syntax direction which uses the results of syntactic analysis to mediatq subsequent processes for manipulating the information tokens. The paper concludes with an illustration of an algorithm for matching the sentences given by a simple grammar against the class of simple pictures which these sentences purport to describe. N THIS PAPER w e shall consider as a single class of information sources that which is usually considered t o be two or perhaps more disjoint classes of information for information processing purposes. To exemplify this class of information sources, the information content of formal scientific and technical documents may be considered, even though in the present pre-systematic state of affairs, wc have no means of quantitatively and precisely speaking of t h e information content of documents (except in the communication theoretic sense which shah not be of concern here).

The term 'directionally selective' means that a unit gives a vigorous discharge of impulses when a stimulus object is moved through its receptive field in one direction (called the preferred direction), whereas motion in the reverse direction (called null) evokes little or no response. The preferred direction differs in different units, and the activity of a set of such units signals the direction of movement of objects in the visual field. In the rabbit the preferred and null directions cannot be predicted from a map of the receptive field showing the regions yielding on or off-responses to stationary spots. Furthermore, the preferred direction is unchanged by changing the stimulus; in particular, reversing the contrast of a spot or a black-white border does not reverse the preferred direction. Hubel & Wiesel (1962) thought that the directional selectivity of the cat's cortical neurons could be explained by the asymmetrical arrangement of on and off zones in the receptive field, and the simple interaction of effects summated over these zones, but the foregoing results rule out this explanation, at least in the rabbit's retina (Barlow & Hill, 1963). In the present paper we go on from this point to describe experiments which show, first, that directional selectivity is not due to optical aberrations of some kind and, secondly, that it is not a simple matter of the latency of response varying systematically across the receptive field. After these negative results we describe experiments upon the organization of directional selectivity within the receptive field, and upon its mechanism. These lead us to the conclusion that the ganglion cells responding to a", "references": ["What-the-Frog's-Eye-Tells-the-Frog's-Brain-Lettvin-Maturana/31d4e7044826dceb19dbe4748b06fae4f67b1456", "Retinal-Ganglion-Cells-Responding-Selectively-to-of-Barlow-Hill/81a9545a3731915ce92e6f6769153c2106929df2", "Computer-Automated-Design-of-Multifont-Print-Logic-Kamentsky-Liu/2e9407b62dd34f68d9b60072e9be3f146ab111b6", "Directional-Movement-and-Horizontal-Edge-Detectors-Maturana-Frenk/1d0ccba7cdb8dd90c0f43dacc77201f02e276591", "Selective-sensitivity-to-direction-of-movement-in-Barlow-Hill/8ad778a1206c79b4cab487d0d36bcb739f9c7623", "Unit-Responses-in-the-Frog's-Tectum-to-Moving-and-GRUESSER-CRONEHLS-Gr%C3%BCsser/073d9cbe9e931e59a72bbd7e7667866e2a89d416", "Receptive-fields%2C-binocular-interaction-and-in-the-Hubel-Wiesel/6b4fe4aa4d66fecc7b2869569002714d91d0b3f7"]},

Brown"], "date": "1952", "abstract": "The condensation of retinene(1) with opsin to form rhodopsin is optimal at pH about 6, a pH which favors the condensation of retinene(1) with sulfhydryl rather than with amino groups. The synthesis of rhodopsin, though unaffected by the less powerful sulfhydryl reagents, monoiodoacetic acid and its amide, is inhibited completely by p-chloromercuribenzoate (PCMB). This inhibition is reversed in part by the addition of glutathione. PCMB does not attack rhodopsin itself, nor does it react with retinene(1). Its action in this system is confined to the -SH groups of opsin. Under some conditions the synthesis of rhodopsin is aided by the presence of such a sulfhydryl compound as glutathione, which helps to keep the -SH groups of opsin free and reduced. By means of the amperometric silver titration of Kolthoff and Harris, it is shown that sulfhydryl groups are liberated in the bleaching of rhodopsin, two such groups for each retinene(1) molecule that appears. This is true equally of rhodopsin from the retinas of cattle, frogs) and squid. The exposure of new sulfhydryl groups adds an important element to the growing evidence that relates the bleaching of rhodopsin to protein denaturation. The place of sulfhydryl groups in the structure of rhodopsin is still uncertain. They may be concerned directly in binding the chromophore to opsin; or alternatively they may furnish hydrogen atoms for some reductive change by which the chromophore is formed from retinene(1). In the amperometric silver titration, the bleaching of rhodopsin yields directly an electrical variation. This phenomenon may have some fundamental connection with the role of rhodopsin in visual excitation, and may provide a model of the excitation process in general.", "references": ["The-cataphoretic-mobility-of-visual-purple.-Broda-Victor/c72bda2445cfe58931407c4e5b7fe4fac0623241", "The-Interplay-of-Light-and-Heat-in-Bleaching-George/112feef56f4bf8eb2c7d2b090e1f120f9974439c", "The-Reversible-Heat-Denaturation-of-Eisenberg-Schwert/7b36461b9e777335411f87df836e261cdf04ac64", "The-chemistry-of-rod-vision.-Wald/2669b2744a760913f75aba1b49b363a97a224707", "Thiol-groups-of-biological-importance.-Barron/b2080aabcd772c986d263b977b1c5e1f28b8b40b", "Amperometric-determination-of-soluble-mercapto-in-Benesch/4f2e97a27ae3e699465e2043661a55703f2400c6"]},

K. Hartline", "Floyd Ratliff"], "date": "1957", "abstract": "The inhibition that is exerted mutually among the receptor units (ommatidia) in the lateral eye of Limulus has been analyzed by recording oscillographically the discharge of nerve impulses in single optic nerve fibers. The discharges from two ommatidia were recorded simultaneously by connecting the bundles containing their optic nerve fibers to separate amplifiers and recording systems. Ommatidia were chosen that were separated by no more than a few millimeters in the eye; they were illuminated independently by separate optical systems. The frequency of the maintained discharge of impulses from each of two ommatidia illuminated steadily is lower when both are illuminated together than when each is illuminated by itself. When only two ommatidia are illuminated, the magnitude of the inhibition of each one depends only on the degree of activity of the other; the activity of each, in turn, is the resultant of the excitation from its respective light stimulus and the inhibition exerted on it by the other. When additional receptors are illuminated in the vicinity of an interacting pair too far from one ommatidium to affect it directly, but near enough to the second to inhibit it, the frequency of discharge of the first increases as it is partially released from the inhibition exerted on it by the second (disinhibition). Disinhibition simulates facilitation; it is an example of indirect effects of interaction taking place over greater distances in the eye than are covered by direct inhibitory interconnections. When only two interacting ommatidia are illuminated, the inhibition exerted on each (decrease of its frequency of discharge) is a linear function of the degree of activity (frequency of discharge) of the other. Below a certain frequency (often different for different receptors) no inhibition is exerted by a receptor. Above this threshold, the rate of increase of inhibition of one receptor with increasing frequency of discharge of the other is constant, and may be at least as high as 0.2 impulse inhibited in one receptor per impulse discharged by the other. For a given pair of interacting receptors, the inhibitory coefficients are not always the same in the two directions of action. The responses to steady illumination of two receptor units that inhibit each other mutually are described quantitatively by two simultaneous linear equations that express concisely all the features discussed above. These equations may be extended and their number supplemented to describe the responses of more than two interacting elements.", "references": ["Spatial-Summation-of-Inhibitory-Influences-in-the-Hartline-Ratliff/5f655c2beb01bbed08908f8bffe776879a93e4bb", "Inhibition-in-the-Eye-of-Limulus-Hartline-Wagner/071924898b2c8a5977424e66287ff5673474db86"]},

Our method is to find what sort of stimulus causes the largest activity in one nerve fiber and then what is the exciting aspect of that stimulus such that variations in everything else cause little change in the response. It has been known for the past 20 years that each fiber is connected not to a few rods and cones in the retina but to very many over a fair area. Our results show that for the most part within that area, it is not the light intensity itself but rather the pattern of local variation of intensity that is the exciting factor. There are four types of fibers, each type concerned with a different sort of pattern. Each type is uniformly distributed over the whole retina of the frog. Thus, there are four distinct parallel distributed channels whereby the frog's eye informs his brain about the visual image in terms of local pattern independent of average illumination. We describe the patterns and show the functional and anatomical separation of the channels. This work has been done on the frog, and our interpretation applies only to the frog.", "references": ["Evidence-That-Cut-Optic-Nerve-Fibers-in-a-Frog-to-Maturana-Lettvin/e9fa0c44ad96fed3c3370f3e88ef035f0aca35fe", "Number-of-Fibres-in-the-Optic-Nerve-and-the-Number-Maturana/22f063bc32cae7adc38ab0f96ea79f6ddb801e6d", "Regeneration-of-the-optic-nerve-in-Xenopus-laevis.-Gaze/aae511515fb3afc62ff3891192647f46ccc32b44", "Retinal-mechanisms-for-chromatic-and-achromatic-Svaetichin-Macnichol/f458a89b3a7da0197458bf0efbb74d459e5cbfde", "The-representation-of-the-retina-on-the-optic-lobe-Gaze/a1091d93392da97cc76a267f68c29eacd955a258", "Change-of-organization-in-the-receptive-fields-of-Barlow-Fitzhugh/929f33d2c4ede915b830e5a47b5007cd4c870386"]},

C. St. George"], "date": "1952", "abstract": "Rhodopsin, the pigment of the retinal rods, can be bleached either by light or by high temperature. Earlier work had shown that when white light is used the bleaching rate does not depend on temperature, and so must be independent of the internal energy of the molecule. On the other hand thermal bleaching in the dark has a high temperature dependence from which one can calculate that the reaction has an apparent activation energy of 44 kg. cal. per mole. It has now been shown that the bleaching rate of rhodopsin becomes temperature-dependent in red light, indicating that light and heat cooperate in activating the molecule. Apparently thermal energy is needed for bleaching at long wave lengths where the quanta are not sufficiently energy-rich to bring about bleaching by themselves. The temperature dependence appears at 590 mmicro. This is the longest wave length at which bleaching by light proceeds without thermal activation, and corresponds to a quantum energy of 48.5 kg. cal. per mole. This value of the minimum energy to bleach rhodopsin by light alone is in agreement with the activation energy of thermal bleaching in the dark. At wave lengths between 590 and 750 mmicro, the longest wave length at which the bleaching rate was fast enough to study, the sum of the quantum energy and of the activation energy calculated from the temperature coefficients remains between 44 and 48.5 kg. cal. This result shows that in red light the energy deficit of the quanta can be made up by a contribution of thermal energy from the internal degrees of freedom of the rhodopsin molecule. The absorption spectrum of rhodopsin, which is not markedly temperature-dependent at shorter wave lengths, also becomes temperature-dependent in red light of wave lengths longer than about 570 to 590 mmicro. The temperature dependence of the bleaching rate is at least partly accounted for by the temperature coefficient of absorption. There is some evidence that the temperature coefficient of bleaching is somewhat greater than the temperature coefficient of absorption at wave lengths longer than 590 mmicro;. This means that the thermal energy of the molecule is a more critical factor in bleaching than in absorption. It shows that some of the molecules which absorb energy-deficient quanta of red light are unable to supply the thermal component of the activation energy needed for bleaching, so bringing about a fall in the quantum efficiency. The experiments show that there is a gradual transition between the activation of rhodopsin by light and the activation by internal energy. It is suggested that energy can move freely between the prosthetic group and the protein moiety of the molecule. In this way a part of the large amount of energy in the internal degrees of freedom of rhodopsin could become available to assist in thermal activation. Assuming that the minimum energy required for bleaching is 48.5 kg. cal., an equation familiar in the study of unimolecular reaction has been used to estimate the number of internal degrees of freedom, n, involved in supplying the thermal component of the activation energy when rhodopsin is bleached in red light. It was found that n increases from 2 at 590 mmicro to a minimum value of 15 at 750 mmicro. One wonders what value n has at 1050 mmicro, where vision still persists, and where rhodopsin molecules may supply some 16 kg. cal. of thermal energy per mole in order to make up for the energy deficit of the quanta.", "references": ["The-photochemistry-of-vision-Wald/4ada6d471bf466a15b262252ad96601d334d19ec", "The-sensitivity-of-the-human-eye-to-infra-red-Griffin-Hubbard/7f00871b5452c3e8c98e1a0e908b47d22e93dbce"]},

Indicator yellow may also be formed without the action of light. Such treatment as is known to bring about denaturation of proteins is effective in bleaching visual purple and producing indicator yellow, e.g. heating of the solution, addition of alkali, acid or organic solvents and violent shaking. Wald [1937] found that a yellow pigment can be extracted with organic solvents from solutions of indicator yellow; this was explained by assuming that bleaching involves rupture of the bond between the protein and the chromophore.

In the past, du Tour (1760) and other scientists found that there was no fusion of the two images, but that always one of a pair of corresponding points suppressed the other. Another view was that of Heine (1900), who held that there was a single common centre which could be stimulated simultaneously by pathways originating from the two retinae. A third view is that of Sherrington (1906), who held that a single sensation arose from the fusion of two sensations which originated separately, one from each visual pathway. Du Tour's theory was put forward before there was any knowledge of depth perception due to disparity of the retinal images. It was considered by both Wheatstone (1838) and Panum (1858), but was thought to be incompatible with data from experiments with stereoscopes, and not to fit in with the idea of disparity as a clue to depth perception. It is proposed here to reconsider du Tour's opinion in relation to the problem of depth perception.

The drop in threshold was rather small compared to that found in human dark adaptation, and the final threshold reached was not nearly as low as one would expect in an eye adapted for nocturnal vision. Pirenne (1954) has emphasized that there is a big discrepancy (a factor of 103-106) between the lowest threshold obtained by electro-physiological methods and the much lower thresholds found by psychophysical methods in humans (Hecht, Shlaer & Pirenne, 1942). In addition, the existence of a random maintained discharge from retinal ganglion cells (Kuffler, FitzHugh & Barlow, 1957) raises some doubts about the relative parts played by the retina and the central nervous system in determining thresholds. We therefore set out to measure the absolute threshold of the large type of ganglion cell (Rushton, 1949) isolated by metallic micro-electrodes of the type used by Granit & Svaetichin (1939). The opportunity was taken of following threshold through the period of dark adaptation, and some observations of the Purkinje shift were made.", "references": ["Maintained-Activity-in-the-Cat's-Retina-in-Light-Kuffler-Fitzhugh/83cf69db1a2897e0bf0a250cfe64a0fcf1835eb7", "The-Statistical-Detection-of-Threshold-Signals-in-Fitzhugh/1cafd6a835be70194ab6aac853888cdaca743fad", "Measurement-of-Rhodopsin-in-the-Living-Human-Eye-Rushton-Campbell/def1bb48455f810bbff86471ca9928d32774968d", "On-the-mechanism-of-the-visual-threshold-and-visual-Wald/878a934bca7c98fdc5ab2079ac88ef784909f6b0"]},

Photographic records of impulses from single ganglion cells in the cat's retina were made while the retina was stimulated by flashes occurring once a second. Ten flashes at each of several intensities near threshold were used. 2. For the purpose of statistical analysis, the number of impulses (x) falling within a critical period following each flash was used as an index of the response. Histograms of x were plotted and used to calculate rates of transfer of information by the ganglion cell for the case of an ideal experiment, the yes-no choice, in which flashes of intensity I and blanks are to be distinguished. 3. The information rate increased (a) with increasing stimulus intensity and (b) with the number of identical flashes or blanks presented successively in a block. The intensity chosen as threshold by the experimenter, who observed the impulses visually and aurally, corresponded to an average information rate for single flashes of 0.7 bit/flash, compared to the maximum possible rate of 1 bit/flash. A threshold intensity giving 0.4 or more bit/flash, if presented in blocks of six identical flashes, corresponded to 0.95 or more bit/block, or near certainty. Thus the calculation of information rates using the index x provides an estimate of threshold at least as sensitive as those obtained during an experiment, which were made only after observing the responses to five to ten flashes of the same intensity. 4. The index x has statistical properties similar to those of the \"index of neural activity\" used by Tanner and Swets (1954) in their statistical model of human vision, and represents a possible physical interpretation of their index. However, x gave values (0.5 to 1.5) of the parameter called the slope which were consistently smaller than their values (2.1 to 3.1).", "references": ["Properties-of-an-infra-red-receptor.-Bullock-Diecke/5685269ea7fc34bac6177da8f0de31b36e9fe0b6", "The-human-use-of-information-I%3A-Signal-detection-of-Tanner-Swets/09dc4bc616b83dcdea522ca261bb8b360571e056", "The-human-use-of-information-II%3A-Signal-detection-Tanner-Norman/927ca28ae5d24ffa21dc4e23b6a4739fbf5742c1", "The-theory-of-signal-detectability-Peterson-Birdsall/4d899ebf7a3004fe550842830f06b4600d9c6230", "Discharge-patterns-and-functional-organization-of-Kuffler/d11cf80190fcef83ac52086ee44876fda7507dfa"]},

Kuffler"], "date": "1953", "abstract": "THE DISCHARGES carried in the optic nerve fibers contain all the information which the central nervous system receives from the retina. A correct interpretation of discharge patterns therefore constitutes an important step in the analysis of visual events. Further, investigations of nervous activity arising in the eye reveal many aspects of the functional organization of the neural elements within the retina itself. Following studies of discharges in the optic nerve of the eel\u2019s eye by Adrian and Matthews (2,3), Hartline and his colleagues described the discharge pattern in the eye of the Limulus in a series of important and lucid papers (for a summary see 20). In the Limulus the relationship between the stimulus to the primary receptor cell and the nerve discharges proved relatively simple, apparently because the connection between sense cell and nerve fiber was a direct one. Thus, when stimulation is confined to one receptor the discharge in a single Limulus nerve fiber will provide a good indication of excitatory events which take place as a result of photochemical processes. Discharges last for the duration of illumination and their frequency is a measure of stimulus strength. Lately, however, it was shown by Hartline et al. (22) that inhibitory interactions may be revealed when several receptors are excited. On the whole, the Limulus preparation shows many features which are similar to other simple sense organs, for instance, stretch receptors. In the latter, however, instead of photochemical events, stretch-deformation acts as the adequate stimulus on sensory terminals and is translated into a characteristic discharge pattern. The discharge from the cold-blooded vertebrate retina (mainly frogs) proved much more complex. Hartline found three main types when recording from single optic nerve fibers: (i) \u201con\u201d discharges, similar to those in the Limulus, firing for the duration of the light stimulus, (ii) \u201coff\u201d discharges appearing when a light stimulus was withdrawn, and (iii) \u2018con-off\u201d discharges, a combination of the former two, with activity confined mainly to onset and cessation of illumination. The mammalian discharge patterns were studied in a number of species by Granit and his co-workers in the course of their extensive work on the physiology of the visual system (summaries in 13, 15). On the whole, they did not observe any fundamental differences between frog and mammalian discharge types (see later).", "references": ["A-multibeam-ophthalmoscope-for-the-study-of-retinal-Talbot-Kuffler/72a0a791c95069ec6b5b3e505e53ba730424d522", "The-peripheral-origin-of-nervous-activity-in-the-Hartline-Wagner/69cd467212c1c3a5a3098afda659d5db6bf743cb", "Stretch-receptor-discharges-during-muscle-Hunt-Kuffler/3e15fa079eb16ebbcf2bac728c86d16639a0a478", "An-analysis-of-the-response-from-single-elements%2C-Donner-Willmer/df00294c4fa74f4007d88aa5cf6d89035a79d74f", "The-Structure-Responsible-for-Action-Potential-in-Rushton/118ce3604eab68c295cb528ee883a1e4d45fd90b", "The-effect-of-illumination-upon-the-sensitivity-of-Donner-Granit/6ca75d48d1cce96a18e9e031be780f267cce9c5e"]},

Recordings were made with metal electrodes or with small micropipettes from ganglion cells or nerve fibers. Continuous maintained discharges were seen in all ganglion cells during steady illumination of their receptive fields, as well as in complete darkness. Possible artefacts, such as electrode pressure, abnormal circulation, anesthetic, and several other factors have been excluded as the source of the maintained discharge. Visual stimuli are therefore transmitted by modulating the ever present background activity. Discharge frequencies were measured following changes of retinal illumination. No consistent patterns of frequency change were found. The maintained discharge frequency may be permanently increased or decreased, or may remain practically unchanged by altering the steady level of illumination. In addition, there were often transient frequency changes during the first 5 to 10 minutes after changing illumination, before a final steady rate was established. A statistical analysis of the impulse intervals of the maintained discharge showed: (a) the intervals were distributed according to the gamma distribution (Pearson's type III), (b) the first serial correlation coefficient of the intervals was between -0.10 and -0.24, with a mean value of -0.17, which is significantly different from zero, (c) the higher order serial correlation coefficients were not significantly different from zero. Thus the firing probability at any time depends on the times of occurrence of the two preceding impulses only, and in such a way as to indicate that each impulse is followed by a transient depression of excitability that outlasts the following impulse. The possible sites at which spontaneous or maintained activity may originate in the retina are discussed.", "references": ["Analysis-of-interval-fluctuation-of-the-sensory-Hagiwara/d3a3e85c6d3e34198c5dec1c43e8c1f0226f2cda", "The-Statistical-Detection-of-Threshold-Signals-in-Fitzhugh/1cafd6a835be70194ab6aac853888cdaca743fad", "Properties-of-an-infra-red-receptor.-Bullock-Diecke/5685269ea7fc34bac6177da8f0de31b36e9fe0b6", "Retinal-noise-and-absolute-threshold.-Barlow/bfe41c7bbea5e3c5b5b2bf70bfd618ae2dd2712c", "Electric-responses-of-individual-nerve-elements-in-Tasaki-Davis/31f8b68210e2c6bd214bd64d0194f9e13ca0f900", "Discharge-patterns-and-functional-organization-of-Kuffler/d11cf80190fcef83ac52086ee44876fda7507dfa", "Special-senses%3A-thermal-receptors.-Zotterman/8675e9e469b7743dfb1d360501c66ddbbdd95580"]},

Fox"], "date": "1954", "abstract": "The problem of signal detectability treated in this paper is the following: Suppose an observer is given a voltage varying with time during a prescribed observation interval and is asked to decide whether its source is noise or is signal plus noise. What method should the observer use to make this decision, and what receiver is a realization of that method? After giving a discussion of theoretical aspects of this problem, the paper presents specific derivations of the optimum receiver for a number of cases of practical interest. The receiver whose output is the value of the likelihood ratio of the input voltage over the observation interval is the answer to the second question no matter which of the various optimum methods current in the literature is employed including the Neyman Pearson observer, Siegert's ideal observer, and.Woodward and Davies' tlobserver.lV An optimum observer required to give a yes or no answer simply chooses an operating level and concludes that the receiver input arose from signal plus noise only when this level is exceeded by the output of his likelihood ratio receiver. Associated with each such operating level are conditional probabilities that the answer is a false alarm and the conditional probability of detection. Graphs of these quantities, called receiver operating characteristic, or ROC, curves are convenient for evaluating a receiver. If the detection problem is changed by varying, for example, the signal power, then a family of ROC curves is generated. Such things as betting curves can easily be obtained from such a family. The operating level to be used in a particular situation must be chosen by the observer. His choice will depend on such factors as the permissable false alarm rate, a priori probabilities, and relative importance of errors. With these theoretical aspects serving as sn introduction, attention is devoted to the derivation of explicit formulas for likelihood ratio, and for probability of detection and probability of false alarm, for a number of particular cases. Stationary, band-limited, white Gaussian noise is assumed.. The seven special cases which sre presented were chosen from the simplest problems in signal detection which closely represent practical situations. Two of the cases form a basis for the best available approximation to the important problem of finding probability of detection when the starting time of the signal, signal frequency, or both, are l l&TlOUn. Furthermore, in these two cases uncertainty in the signal can be varied, and a quantitative relationship between uncertainty and ability to detect signals is presented for these two rather general cases. The variety of examples presented should serve to suggest methods for attacking other simple signal detection problems and to give insight into problems too complicated to allow a direct solution.", "references": []},

In the cat, the majority of studies reveal a dramatic loss of binocularity and direction selectivity in superficial collicular units following ablation of the visual cortex (1, 18, 25). In the ground squirrel, removal of the visual cortex renders most cells in the intermediate and deep layers of the superior colliculus unresponsive to visual stimuli (14); this also appears to apply to the cat (22). Work on the rabbit, however, indicates that in this species, ablation of visual cortex produces no discernible effects on collicular function (10). The present study has been undertaken to investigate the contribution of visual cortex to collicular function in the rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta), a species whose visual svstem is believed to be rather similar to that of man. Neuroanatomical work has indicated that in the monkey, as in the cat, retina and visual cortex project densely on the superior colliculus (8). In the monkey, a foveate animal, an interesting specialization has been reported: anterograde-degeneration and autoradiographic studies indicate that the anterior part of the colliculus, representing the central 5\u201d of the visual field, receives extremely sparse or no terminations from the retina and, conversely, heavy projections from visual cortex (5, 9, 26) Single-unit studies of the superior colliculus of the intact monkey have disclosed that, as in the cat, most cells have binocular", "references": ["Retinotopic-fidelity-of-striate-cortex-superior-in-McIlwain/f3f4fa476d3cc4572fe782e424411d74225859f1", "Topographic-relationships-in-projection-from-cortex-McIlwain/322deda02290f4bb4c8dc637431dc8561aac6a6e", "Activity-of-superior-colliculus-in-behaving-monkey.-Wurtz-Goldberg/31d32ffc4a17a7a13d5aa795e1b32e1261355f7d", "Comparison-of-receptive-field-organization-of-the-Berman-Cynader/0e3365dbf0c13d5d97c759ad523aefc0728c14e6", "Eye-movements-evoked-by-collicular-stimulation-in-Robinson/da489fdca8f59f0f0d8ce5289d35f4aa93b75e7c", "Receptive-field-organization-of-monkey-superior-Cynader-Berman/c1e1c160ed7bbb4ff42f108d5bbd027f6ff6b83a", "Synaptic-patterns-in-the-superficial-layers-of-the-Lund/be8419ac3a1aa68dec502a5af10180996326adb1", "Visual-receptive-fields-of-single-neurons-in-of-the-Michael/e8bafc515c9f189331d220260016b5dfd9205f63", "Discharge-characteristics-of-single-units-in-of-the-Schiller-Koerner/3b292431072ce0555191832ec80e5b2aee3fc3e8"]},

Cat retinal ganglion cells may be subdivided into sustained and transient response-types by the application of a battery of simple tests based on responses to standing contrast, fine grating patterns, size and speed of contrasting targets, and on the presence or absence of the periphery effect. The classification is equivalent to the ;X'/;Y' (linear/nonlinear) subdivision of Enroth-Cugell & Robson which is thus confirmed and extended.2. The sustained/transient classification applied to both on-centre and off-centre cells.3. Lateral geniculate neurones may be similarly classified by the same tests. Occasional concentrically organized cells had a mixture of sustained and transient properties.4. A technique for simultaneous recording from a geniculate neurone and one or more retinal ganglion cells providing its excitatory input showed that the connexions were specific with respect to the sustained/transient classification as well as the on-centre/off-centre classification. Most geniculate neurones are excitatorily driven only by retinal ganglion cells of the same functional type. In a few cases the inputs were mixed but only with respect to the sustained/transient classification.5. Sustained retinal ganglion cells had slower-conducting axons than the transient type. The same was true for lateral geniculate neurones but in this case the distributions showed considerable overlap.6. The sustained/transient classification is the functional correlate for the well-known segregation of optic nerve fibres into two conduction groups.7. The pathways carrying sustained and transient information remain essentially separate from retina through the lateral geniculate nucleus to the striate cortex.", "references": []},

I. Spatiotemporal organization of receptive fields.", "authors": ["Peter H. Schiller", "Barbara L. Finlay", "S F Volman"], "date": "1976", "abstract": "1. The properties of single cells in striate cortex of the rhesus monkey, representing the visual field 2 degrees -5 degrees from the fovea, were examined quantitatively with stationary and moving stimuli. Three distinct classes of cells were identified: S type, CX type, and T type. 2. S-type cells were defined as those oriented cells which to the optimal direction of movement in their receptive fields exhibited one or more spatially separate subfields within each of which a response was obtained to either a light or dark edge, but not to both. Several different types of S-cells were distinguished: a) S1-type cells for which moving edges revealed a single excitatory area within which a response was elicited by either a light or a dark edge but not by both. Most of these cells were unidirectional. b) S2-type cells for which moving edges revealed two spatially separate response areas, one of which was excited by a light edge and the other by a dark edge. Both regions responded to the same direction of movement. c) S3-type cells which had two response areas, one of which was excited by a stimulus moving in one direction (at right angles to the axis of orientation) and the other, of opposite contrast, which responded in the opposite direction, d) S4-type cells which to one direction of movement showed two spatially separate regions sensitive to a light and dark edge and which in the other direction of movement had only one responsive area (either light or dark). e) Cells which had multiple spatially separate subfields (S5-7 types). 3. CX-type cells were defined as those oriented cells which in their receptive fields exhibited no spatial separation for light- and dark-edge responses; they discharged to both edges in the same direction of movement and in the same spatial area. Flashing stimuli elicited both on and off responses throughout the receptive field. CX-type cells were predominantly of two types: those which were selective for direction of stimulus movement and those which were not. 4. A third class of cells (T-type) were those which were excited by only one sign of contrast change and responded in a sustained fashion even when there was no contour within the receptive field. These cells were poorly or not at all oriented; some of them were selective to wavelength. 5. Quantitative comparisons showed the following differences between S-type and CX-type cells: a) S-type cells had smaller receptive fields than CX-type cells but the populations over-lapped considerably. Receptive-field size was smallest in layer 4c. In all other layers S-type cells had the same size fields. CX-type cells, by contrast, tended to have larger fields in layer 5-6 than 2-3. b) The spatial separation between light and dark response areas was the best criterion for distinguishing S-type and CX-type cells. The distribution of this measure disclosed two populations of cells with relatively limited overlap. c) In layers 2 and 3, both S-type and CX-type cells had low spontaneous activity...", "references": ["Functional-classes-of-cells-and-their-laminar-in-Dow/9c333b263aaf7671b55cddae75e89639fb2a7ac2", "The-visual-cortex-as-a-spatial-frequency-analyser.-Maffei-Fiorentini/929418e2cdee45d16d0493b9a2361fcc8682be2d", "Sequence-regularity-and-geometry-of-orientation-in-Hubel-Wiesel/1c387b70f37fd902735e6c2b76d9715a251d1b5e", "Receptive-fields-and-functional-architecture-of-Hubel-Wiesel/1116467d67f475d1bd2539862f10f792032fe13b", "Receptive-Fields-and-Functional-Architecture-in-Two-Hubel-Wiesel/f70c54029c17f50914996c834930ecbfacda195f", "Receptive-fields%2C-binocular-interaction-and-in-the-Hubel-Wiesel/6b4fe4aa4d66fecc7b2869569002714d91d0b3f7", "Receptive-fields-of-single-neurones-in-the-cat's-Hubel-Wiesel/6f20e254e3993538c79e0ff2b9b8f198d3359cb3", "Short-term-response-variability-of-monkey-striate-Schiller-Finlay/49966d7bc963d8d6e1bc67fe0246461e604c85e3", "Response-characteristics-of-single-cells-in-the-or-Schiller-Stryker/af0c7e6926b1eaa4b61284cecfe9258b586b1b82"]},

Action potentials from single elements in the cochlear nucleus have already been successfully recorded by Galambos and Davis (2, 3, 4) with an earlier type of microelectrode. The original purpose of the present investigation was to repeat their previous observations with a finer technique. There is a certain difference in behavior between the elements examined in the present investigation and those studied previously. The \u201cresponse area\u201d of an element is the area on an intensity-frequency plot that includes all tones that evoke a positive response. The response areas of the new elements show a sharp limit on the high-frequency side and very gradual elevation of threshold on the low-frequency side. The elements studied previously had, on the contrary, fairly narrow response areas with a clear maximum of sensitivity for a certain frequency that was characteristic of the element under observation. The new and the previous elements behaved differently in one other aspect: spontaneous discharges of impulses in the new elements were not inhibited by the application of any pure tone, while in the previous elements some tones inhibited and other tones enhanced the spontaneous repetitive activity.", "references": ["Action-Potentials-From-Single-Auditory-Nerve-Fibers-Galambos-Davis/fc52ac4fa00e5bde16f1c2864f5485a7f9205173", "Action-potentials-from-individual-elements-in-cat-Tasaki-Polley/08fbd017a73f5ea8726b0787d665c62c33f27df7", "Nerve-impulses-in-individual-auditory-nerve-fibers-Tasaki/3a2424648f4fc52ef937cd67c28a08b68fae71a2", "The-normal-membrane-potential-of-frog-sartorius-Ling-Gerard/23617130d1b467578b5433562d077c0cb5c9fb47"]},

How is it possible to get such good insulation in a packed structure like the retina using a 25-\u00b5 electrode? Why are large isolated spikes only found in some spots and not elsewhere? Is it because some typical structure happens to be exceptionally favourably placed for recording, or is the structure a comparatively rare one?

Hubel", "Torsten N.

The arrangement of the columns is highly ordered; in the great majority of oblique or tangential microelectrode penetrations the preferred orientations of cells changed systematically with electrode position, in a clockwise or counterclockwise direction. Graphs of orientation vs. electrode track distance were virtually straight lines over distances of up to several millimeters; such orderly sequences were often terminated by sudden changes in the direction of orientation shifts, from clockwise to counterclockwise or back. The orientations at which these reversals occurred were quite unpredictable. Total rotations of 18% 360\u201d were frequently seen between reversals. In tangential or almost tangential penetrations orientation shifts occurred almost every time the electrode was moved forward, indicating that the columns were either not discrete or had a thickness of less than 25-50 p, the smallest order of distance that our methods could resolve. In penetrations that were almost perpendicular to the surface, the graphs of orientation vs. track distance were relatively flatter, as expected if the surfaces of constant orientation are perpendicular to the cortical surface. S tep wise changes in orientation of about 10\u201d could sometimes be seen in perpendicular penetrations, each orientation persisting through several clear advances of the electrode, suggesting a set of discrete columnar subdivisions. The possibility of some kind of continuous variation in orientation with horizontal distance along the cortex was not, however, completely ruled out. Occasionaliy a highly ordered sequence was broken by an abrupt large shift in orientation of up to 90\u201d. Shifts in ocular dominance occurred roughly every 0.25-0.5 mm and were independent of orientation shifts. In multiple parallel penetrations spaced closer than about 250 p the slopes of the orientation vs. track distance curves were almost the same; reconstruction of these penetrations indicated that the regions of constant orientation are parallel sheets. On crossing perpendicular to these sheets, a total orientation shift of 180\u201d took place over a distance of 0.51.0 mm. Column thickness, size of shifts in orientation, and the rate of change of orientation with distance along the cortex seemed to be independent of eccentricity, at least between 2 \u201d and 15\u201d from the fovea. A few penetrations made in area 17 of the cat and in area 18 of the monkey showed similar orderly sequences of receptive-field orienta-", "references": ["Laminar-and-columnar-distribution-of-fibers-in-the-Hubel-Wiesel/e5f4f49721eb3f6bdba304a06728327631e832bb", "Lateral-inhibition-between-orientation-detectors-in-Blakemore-Tobin/0ecd7852e14137e98957f1b25a376ea60c7322e6", "Modality-and-topographic-properties-of-single-of-Mountcastle/25da3e1aa66df347c0ef3bf90d00543e091a9b8d"]},

Ablation experiments indicate that lesions in the hamster superior colliculus can cause severe deficits in orienting to visual and auditory stimuli while leaving intact the ability to discriminate pat serns in situ .ations in whi ch no orienting component is necessary for the successful performance of the discrimination (32). Related to this view is the idea that the colliculus plays an important role in the control of eye and head movements. After unilateral colliculectomy in the monkey, Denny-Brown (6) reports a fascinating cluster of eye-movement deficits. While the animal could look to either side or up and down, there was a slight divergent strabismus, and the optokinetic response was present only when the stripes entered the visual field from the operated side. Though the monkey could reach accurately for an object in the visual field contralateral to the lesion, he could not fixate the object, but only looked in its general direction. After bilateral colliculus lesions, monkeys showed fixed gaze, lack of reactivity to visual stimuli; lack of vocalization, and a variety of other deficits which led Denny-Brown to describe this structure as the \u201cpattern setter of the nervous system.\u201d Though other workers have failed to confirm the oculomotor deficits reported in this study (2, 28), recent work usi *g more sophisticated methods for head immobilization and eyemovement recording has confirmed and extended many of Denny-Brown\u2019s original observations (M.

In 1942, Galambos and and Davis (9) recorded electric responses of single ganglion cells in the cochlear nucleus, which they once believed to be from single auditory nerve fibers. Those responses, recorded from the secondary neurons in the auditory system, indicate that each element responds to a tone of a particular frequency with a particularly high sensitivity. Galambos (8) also described an inhibitory interaction between the responses to two different sound stimuli in the cochlear nucleus. It is therefore possible that the selective response of each element at this level of the auditory system to a particular frequency could be largely due to some complicated interaction among nerve impulses arriving at the cochlear nucleus over a large number of primary auditory nerve fibers. Quite recently, it has been shown in this Institute (21,22) that the basal turn of the guinea pig cochlea responds to practically all frequencies in the audible range, while the upper parts of the cochlea respond only to sounds of low frequencies. By the method of differential recording of the microphonic response across the cochlear partition, it was shown that when the response of the upper part of the cochlea (to low-frequency sounds) had been eliminated by a local injection of an isotonic KC1 solution there were still good normal responses in the basal turn, both microphonics and nerve action potentials. These results exclude any sharp localization of vibratory motion in the cochlea. The \u201cresonance curve\u201d obtained by Bekesy (3), which correlates mechanical displacement of the cochlear partition of the dead human and animal ears with place in the cochlea at various frequencies, is not very sharp. Nevertheless, the large microphonic and nerve action potentials induced by low-frequency sound in the basal turn still seem difficult to reconcile with Bekesy\u2019s curves, which show a fairly rapid decay in amplitude of vibration toward the basal turn. More direct information as to the nerve impulses in the primary auditory neurons seemed to offer a solution of this difficulty.", "references": ["Direct-membrane-resting-and-action-potentials-from-Woodbury/8eb023ccbccc0ee6d9515c465eccbc5775045dbf", "Modification-of-cochlear-microphonics-and-action-by-Tasaki-Fernandez/2f5ce95dda4223c7f2aa2dfb75ea17f1a65f3a3b", "Properties-of-myelinated-fibers-in-frog-sciatic-and-Tasaki/ec2c6cad20eda70ca8ef346d2973362a56acbd0a", "Repetitive-responses-of-the-nerve-fiber%2C-as-by-and-Sato/2b690570512365ee0a2f4e1f4e9e9db5350ee35e", "The-peripheral-origin-of-activity%2C-with-reference-Davis-Tasaki/3496406b96f72da25ce827284921291d0f242eec"]},

Cynader"], "date": "1972", "abstract": "1. The superior colliculus has been studied in Siamese and normal cats by recording the responses of single tectal units to visual stimuli.2. The retinotopic organization of the superior colliculus has been compared in the two breeds. In the normal cat, the contralateral half-field is represented in the central and caudal part of the colliculus, and a vertical strip of the ipsilateral half-field, 15-20 degrees wide, is represented at the anterior tip. The Siamese cat superior colliculus receives an abnormally large projection from the ipsilateral half-field so that units with visual receptive fields which extend as far as 40 degrees into the ipsilateral half-field can be found. The area of the tectal surface devoted to the representation of the ipsilateral half-field is about twice as large in Siamese cats as in normal cats. The enhanced representation of the ipsilateral half-field in Siamese cats is reflected in a displacement of the vertical meridian and the area centralis on the tectal surface.3. The area centralis in the Siamese cat is located at about the same point on the tectal surface as would be occupied by a point in the visual field about 6-7 degrees contralateral to the area centralis in the normal cat. The smallest receptive fields in both breeds are located near the area centralis. The size of the receptive field for a tectal unit seems to be determined by the retinal location of the receptive field and not by the absolute position of the unit on the tectal surface.4. The receptive-field characteristics of tectal units show many similarities in the two breeds. The receptive fields of individual units consist of activating regions flanked by suppressive surrounds. Units respond well to stimuli of different shapes and orientation provided they are moving. The optimum stimulus for a given unit can be much smaller than the size of the activating region. About two thirds of the units studied in both breeds show directional selectivity. Most of the units studied in normal cats can be activated by stimulation of either eye, while in Siamese cats, 80% of the units studied can be driven only by the contralateral eye. A few monocularly driven units with two separated receptive fields have been observed in Siamese cats.5. In the left tectum of both breeds, units respond well to left-to-right stimulus movement. The reverse situation obtains in the right tectum. In Siamese cats, units located at the anterior tip of the tectum with their receptive fields located in the visual half-field ipsilateral to the tectum under study respond better to stimulus movement toward the area centralis than away from it. The preferred direction for a tectal unit seems to be determined by its tectal location rather than by the location of its receptive field in the retina.6. Visual cortex lesions in both breeds increase the responsiveness of tectal units to flashing spots and almost entirely remove the directional selectivity exhibited by tectal units, although units with asymmetric surrounds are still found. In normal cats, the lesions change the ocular dominance distribution, skewing it more strongly toward the contralateral eye. In Siamese cats, the ocular dominance distribution remains unchanged after a visual cortex lesion.7. The squint commonly exhibited by Siamese cats is regarded as a compensation for the anomalous retinotectal topography. It is suggested that, in the absence of an adaptive modification, the anomalous retinotectal projection would lead to mislocalization in Siamese cats just as it does in frogs and hamsters whose retinotectal projection has been experimentally altered. The convergent strabismus which Siamese cats commonly exhibit may be a cure for the abnormal retinal projections rather than a disease.", "references": []},

Therefore, it may be necessary to examine whether the frequency of the repetitive response may be determined by the recovery curve or by the response time and to secure rigid experimental data on strength-frequency and strength-duration relations of repetitive responses of a single nerve fiber, although there are accumulated many experimental findings concerning the repetitive responses of the nerve (Fessard, 1936 (6), Erlanger and Blair, 1936 (4) and Arvanitaki, 1938 (2) etc.). The results of this investigation indicated very clearly, against Hodgkin's view, that the frequency of the repetitive responses can be determined by both the recovery curve and the accommodation of the nerve fiber and that the theoretical formula for the threshold condition of the repetition presented in this appendix proved to yield results which agree well with the observed values.", "references": []},

A large motor fiber was isolated from a sciatic-gastrocnemius preparation, and the operated region of the preparation, immersed in Ringer's fluid, was brought under a polarizing microscope with an objective lens of water-immersion type. A micro-electrode of below 0.5 micron in diameter, held by means of a micro-manipulator, was pushed into the nerve fiber, and the potential difference between the intra-cellular electrode and the outside fluid medium was recorded with a cathode-ray oscillograph used in conjunction with a DC amplifier. Action potentials were elicited from the fiber by induction shocks applied to the proximal nerve trunk. Muscular contractions were taken as an index of the propagation of impulses across the impaled region. The main features of the results obtained are as follows: 1. When the tip of the micro-electrode was just under the layer of myelin or when a dimpling of myelin into the axis-cylinder was seen at the tip of the micro-electrode, there was practically no measurable resting potential . But a propagated nerve impulse could very often evoke sizable monophasic action potentials (generally not exceeding 30 mV in peak value) . At this stage, propagation of impulses across the impaled region was not impaired. 2. When the tip of the micro-electrode was introduced deep inside the axis-cylinder, a resting potential of 10 to 40 mV was observed. The action potentials observed at this stage were large at the beginning (20 to 40 mV), but soon a notch appeared at the peak of the action potential . As time elapsed, this notch became more pronounced, and generally within 2 to 5 minutes after introduction of the micro-electrode, a stage was reached at which the part of action potential following the notch suddenly disappeared . Propagation across the impaled region was blocked at this moment . The first part of the present investigation is an extension of the abovestated experiments done in England.

In this subsection we introduce \"the transition matr ix,\" a table which describes a net by showing the various ways in which it may pass from one delay state to another. We use a characterizing table with M input (state) words I, N internalstate words S, and M X N rows, each of the form <<I, S > , S ' > , to define N 2 direct-transition expressions I~j as follows. I ~ is a disjunction of all those I~ such tha t <<Ik, S~>, S i > is a row of the characterizing table; if there are no such Ik , then I~s is \u00a2 (\"the false\"). Tha t is, I~i is a disjunction of all those input words (if any) which can cause the net to pass from state S~ at time t to state Sj at t ime t + 1; it is allowed that i equals j . I t is clear that each I~i is a disjunctive normal form expression of the input function variables. Note tha t the direct-transition expression \"~b\" is distinct from the directtransition expressions \"0\", \"00\", \"000\", etc.; the former means that no direct transition between the two states is possible, while the latter mean that such a transition is brought about by making all the inputs zero. A direct transition from S~ to S~ in a net is a passage from state S~ at t to state S~ at t + 1. Such a transition is possible only in the case where I~i ~ \u00a2. We say that < I k , S~> (or Ik S~) at time t directly produces Si at time t -~ 1 only in the case where the net makes a direct transition from S~ to Sy under the influence of input Ik at t. A transition from S~ to Si in a net is a passage from state S~ at t to state S~ at t ~ w (w > 0).

Furthermore, there are no sharp necessary conditions for a language to be type 1; for example, it is not known whether the class of type 1 languages is closed under complementation, although the author suspects that this is not the case.

Just as wc arc able to read and to recognize shapes under the most varied conditions, so arc frogs able to scc their prey and to fccd upon it under the bright light of midday or under the twilight of morning or evening, whether this bc in their natural environment or in a small cage in the laboratory. How is this accomplished? How do frogs recognize the universals, prey and enemy? To survive, a frog needs to react rapidly, either to catch a prey or to escape an enemy. To do this, the pat tern of light and dark that is the original image formed on the retina has to be anaJyzed, sooner or later, to select from it the features which define the universals.

In addition, the C laminae projected to the superficial half of layer I, which the A laminae did not. Conversely, while the A laminae projected to layer VI, the C laminae did not. The two sets of laminae also showed differences in the areas to which they projected. The A geniculate laminae projected to areas 17 and 18, whereas the C geniculate laminae had a more extensive projection, including areas 17, 18, 19 and other areas on the suprasylvian gyrus. The laminar organization of the projection to area 18 was similar to that found in area 17. At the electron microscopic level the geniculate terminals were found to make Gray's type 1 synapses, for the most part onto dendritic spines. Labeled terminals were found in all the projection bands seen in the light microscope. The implications of these findings on the connectivity of cells in layer IV are discussed. The presence of labeled terminals in layer VI, which contains the cells of origin of the corticogeniculate pathway, suggests that the recurrent loop to the LGN is mediated monosynaptically. Finally, the afferents from each geniculate lamina were found to be segregated into patches, about 500 mum wide, which probably form the anatomical basis for ocular dominance columns.", "references": ["Evidence-of-W-cell-input-to-the-cat's-visual-cortex-Wilson-Stone/c9fd1e12aaa354eedd5a3c63d5df9cf523cd0376", "Long-latency-retinal-input-to-lateral-geniculate-of-Cleland-Morstyn/1bfcea35267d6957eb7ea80700b83a3bdda269c1", "The-origin-of-efferent-pathways-from-the-primary-of-Lund-Lund/477a0f55cb4b88a5d610103c797d16d5523201e6", "The-projections-of-cells-in-different-layers-of-the-Gilbert-Kelly/17ca3842ab4ce43485c385a28ba6f5c671edc43c", "The-projections-of-different-morphological-types-of-Kelly-Gilbert/c44233c7aee8d03ce2c508d7c1cd6a72bd6178af", "An-autoradiographic-study-of-retinogeniculate-in-Hickey-Guillery/da0f32754604074dd82944df25ec779c17813a81", "An-autoradiographic-study-of-the-projections-of-the-Rosenquist-Edwards/4cebce49a943616904bd20142235665cf4db1c73", "Autoradiographic-demonstration-of-ocular-dominance-Wiesel-Hubel/0c8ef5350359847cf54d2b909014951a3c619b61", "Accumulation-of-radioactive-protein-in-mouse-cortex-Specht-Grafstein/9c0a9e5580a953b6fba9d2f20b4f093eccfe0855", "Projection-of-X-and-Y-cells-of-the-cat's-lateral-to-Stone-Dreher/3f19dd2bd8fb3e0d6e001d2f92a5599724813a8b"]},

Hildreth"], "date": "1980", "abstract": "A theory of edge detection is presented. The analysis proceeds in two parts. (1) Intensity changes, which occur in a natural image over a wide range of scales, are detected separately at different scales. An appropriate filter for this purpose at a given scale is found to be the second derivative of a Gaussian, and it is shown that, provided some simple conditions are satisfied, these primary filters need not be orientation-dependent. Thus, intensity changes at a given scale are best detected by finding the zero values of delta 2G(x,y)*I(x,y) for image I, where G(x,y) is a two-dimensional Gaussian distribution and delta 2 is the Laplacian. The intensity changes thus discovered in each of the channels are then represented by oriented primitives called zero-crossing segments, and evidence is given that this representation is complete. (2) Intensity changes in images arise from surface discontinuities or from reflectance or illumination boundaries, and these all have the property that they are spatially. Because of this, the zero-crossing segments from the different channels are not independent, and rules are deduced for combining them into a description of the image. This description is called the raw primal sketch. The theory explains several basic psychophysical findings, and the operation of forming oriented zero-crossing segments from the output of centre-surround delta 2G filters acting on the image forms the basis for a physiological model of simple cells (see Marr & Ullman 1979).", "references": ["A-four-mechanism-model-for-threshold-spatial-vision-Wilson-Bergen/b45c9da1e49cce9f37976d9187f85fb217d8d092", "Threshold-visibility-of-frequency-gradient-patterns-Wilson-Giese/4af0b5b557b4067a22a9c4c59fdf7bf0ff938eae", "Directional-selectivity-and-its-use-in-early-visual-Marr-Ullman/1b4103fb265b0c296e8649b698a0fefff5790a00", "A-computational-theory-of-human-stereo-vision.-Marr-Poggio/fafd813987f868fbbd904520a68607166c66ea85", "Bandpass-channels%2C-zero-crossings%2C-and-early-visual-Marr-Ullman/4f9c33f25eb2f76de3ccb531e85910630d0ff6f5", "Size%2C-scatter-and-coverage-of-ganglion-cell-field-Peichl-W%C3%A4ssle/25f2aa5140b2fd7c5bb6ece45a505be53cacd41a", "Disparity-sensitivity-and-receptive-field-of-units-Heydt-Adorjani/1170a8636f862d3af7687cbe9f1422809576d65f", "Suprathreshold-contrast-perception-and-complex-Mayhew-Frisby/9f6f691a413153b705ba62c304c59eca4005b15e", "Independence-of-black-and-white%3A-phase-specific-Valois/e58e6ad45c653c9aef543eff53b20e00fb422d82"]},

The responses of the units have been measured in terms of either the frequency of impulses, or the contrast sensitivity, and expressed as a function of the spatial frequency of the grating pattern.3. The amplitude of the responses recorded from cortical cell bodies was dependent upon the orientation of the moving grating, and for these units the stimulus was always presented at the preferred orientation. The response amplitude of other units did not depend upon the orientation of the grating stimulus, and these are believed to be the terminations of geniculate fibres.4. The high spatial frequency end of the response function measured in terms of the contrast sensitivity could be well fitted by an exponential function. Subtraction of the blank count from the impulse frequency data gave a curve fitted by the same exponential function. The low frequency end was less consistent.5. The spatial frequency at which this exponential function had fallen by one log. unit was taken to specify the position of the unit's response in the spatial frequency spectrum. For all units these values cover a range of four octaves of spatial frequency (from 0.18 to 3.8 cycles per degree).6.

Complex cells in cortical areas 17 and 18 of the cat have been studied in response to narrow slits and edges moving across the receptive field in the preferred direction and also to stationary slits of different widths. 2. Average response histograms, recorded as a narrow slit was moved across the receptive field, displayed a periodic series of peaks above a base line level. The response histogram for most area 17 and 18 cells contained five principal peaks; sometimes one or two weaker peaks were present at receptive field borders. The histogram for one cell located at the area 17-18 border showed thirteen distinct peaks. Periodic response patterns were also generated as an extended edge was moved across the receptive field. Plots of cell responses versus slit width for stationary slits of different widths also indicated periodic response pattern. 3. The accuracy of determining the preferred slit orientation was the single most important requirement for demonstrating the periodic response pattern. Significant changes in the appearance of the periodic pattern occurred even upon 5 degrees rotations away from the preferred orientation. 4. Average response histograms were also studied over a wide range of moving slit velocities. The number of peaks across corresponding spacings within the recewptive field remained constant over a range of velocities. Response amplitudes, however, were velocity dependent. Thus the response peaks remain associated with fixed positions within visual space independent of stimulus velocity, even though temporal as well as spatial factors may be involved in response selectivity and the periodic modulation. The most striking periodic response histograms were generated at the velocities which produced the greatest cell firing rates. Area 17 complex cells responded well to velocities of less than 0-5 degrees to 6-0 degrees/sec, but cells in area 18 generally required higher velocities, sometimes as high as 20 degrees--30 degrees/sec, for a good response. 5. Spatial frequencies for the periodic component of the receptive field for area 17 cells in the central visual area covered a range of three octaves up to 5 cycles/degree, and area 18 cells included another octave on the low frequency side. The spatial frequency of a cell was found to be roughly inversely proportional to the receptive field width.

The discharge frequency of simple neurones in the cat striate cortex responding to the two edges of a slit of light moving over their receptive fields was studied as a function of slit width. While one edge of the slit was discharging the cell, the other edge had a modifying influence on that discharge either by way of facilitation or of inhibition.2. The most common form of the curve relating discharge frequency and slit width had a maximal discharge at narrow slit widths (< 0.5 degrees ) and relative inhibition at medium widths (between 0.5 degrees and 2 degrees ). At greater slit widths there was usually a region of facilitation before the effects of the two edges became independent of one another. Three other response patterns to slits of different width are described.3. The curve relating slit width and response amplitude for a particular cell provides an important clue to the various activity profiles for that cell. An activity profile plots the excitability of a cell along a line through the receptive field in the direction of stimulus movement. Each type of edge, light and dark, has its own set of activity profiles which differ depending upon stimulus parameters such as the direction of the movement of the edge.4. Two other methods were used to provide further data concerning the activity profiles and as a check on the evidence provided by the responses to slits of different width. One of these two methods used the test stimulus against the background of an artificially produced maintained discharge and the other involved the interaction of the two receptive fields of binocularly activated cells.5. A model is put forward to explain the receptive field organization of simple striate neurones which takes into account not only the main features of what is known concerning the synaptology of the visual cortex but also the new data provided by the present paper and the one which precedes it.", "references": []},

Clearly f ( y , x ) + g ( y , x ) = f ( x , y ) + g ( x , y ) , while f ( x , z )+ g(x, z) < f (x , y) + f(y , z) + g(x, y) + g(y, z) = f (x , y) + g(x, y) + f (y , z) + g(y, z). The proofs for max(f, g) are analogous. COROLLARY. If f l . . . . . f , satisfy (a), (b) or (c), so d o f t + . . . +fn and max(f l . . . . . f,). Proposition 2. f[(i, j), (h, k)] = l i hL and g[(i, j), (h, k)] = I J kl are distance functions. Proof: (a)-(b) are clear; as for (c), note that f[(m, n), (p, q)] = f [ (m+r, n), (p+r, q)] for any m, so that it suffices to prove f[(i, jk(h,k)] <fE(i,j),(O,O)]+f[(h,k),(O,O)], i.e. l i -hl <<_ Iil +lhl, which is a well known property of absolute value, and similarly for g. COROLLARY. dl[(i,j), (h, k)] = l i -hl +l j k [ and d2[(i,j), (h, k)] = max( l i -h l , I j k [ ) are distance functions. (d I is sometimes called city block distance.) Proposition 3.

A troublesome question arises in this connection: where does perception leave off and inductive reasoning begin? The abstraction of simple homogeneities from a visual field does not appear to be different, in its formal aspects, from the induction of a highly general scientific law from a mass of experimental data. Certain subjective differences are obvious enough: thus reasoning seems to involve conscious effort, whereas perception seems to involve a set of processes whereby information is predigested before it ever reaches awareness. When extrapolations are required of a subject in an experimental situation, however, it is difficult or impossible for the experimenter to be certain whether the subject is responding on an \"intuitive\" or a \"deliberative\" basis.

Laboratory Working Papers are produced for internal circulation, and may contain information that is, for example, too preliminary or too detailed for formal distribution. Although some will be given a limited external distribution , it is not intended that they should be considered papers to which reference can be made in the literature. ABSTRACT The shape of an object can be determined from the shading in a single image by solving a first-order, non-linear partial differential equation. The method of characteristics can be used to do this, but it suffers from a number of theoretical difficulties and implementation problems. This thesis presents an iterative relaxation algorithm for solving this equation on a grid of points. Here, repeated local computations eventually lead to a global solution. The algorithm solves for the surface orientation at each point by employing an iterative relaxation scheme. The constraint of surface smoothness is achieved while simultaneously satisfying the constraints imposed by the equation of image illumination. The algorithm has the distinct advantage of being capable of handling any reflectance function, whether analytically or empirically specified. Included are brief overviews of some of the more important shape-from-shading algorithms in existence and a list of potential applications of this iterative approach to several image domains including scanning electron microscopy, remote sensing of topography and industrial inspection.", "references": ["Reflectance-map-techniques-for-analyzing-surface-in-Woodham/280d2ed6a3a6cd1a7c50f820e8f4faa927805098", "Partial-Differential-Equations-(-Week-3-%2B-4-)-Holzegel/c1d2198b0bd84f8e0f23fae201d77896d38bc322", "Automated-leukocyte-recognition-using-fuzzy-Ghosh-Das/c192e440a91ef63946ae060dfd9aaf941443f1d8", "A-rapidly-convergent-descent-method-for-.-A-Rapidly-Fletcher-Powell/c4164ca9d240ae91210c618315b0a34f3d4f4eca", "Variable-Metric-Method-for-Minimization-Davidon/04a230c976e22278f01e024310bbfc8627cde139", "A-computational-theory-of-human-stereo-vision.-Marr-Poggio/fafd813987f868fbbd904520a68607166c66ea85", "Calculating-the-reflectance-map.-Horn-Sjoberg/5a6946d8e2c8934c24faad2bb8f125534183bd96", "Surface-perception-from-local-analysis-of-texture-Stevens/d9a28454e766b01b3e9622bb926471929df5ee24"]},

We have examined and compared the ability of binocularly activated striate neurons to make both position disparity and orientation disparity discrimination in the anesthetized (N2O/O2) and paralyzed cat preparation. 2. Accurate knowledge of eye position is essential for disparity studies. Using a retinal projection technique able to detect eye drifts of less than 3' arc per retinal landmark and less than 18' arc cyclorotation disparity, we determined eye drift during the course of 2- to 4-day experiments. After the initial eye rotation due to the anesthesia and the onset of paralysis (see below), rotational drift thereafter was mainly excyclorotatory and, from all causes, rarely totaled more than 4 degrees disparity. All our data have been corrected for this residual cyclorotatory drift. 3. Optimal stimulus orientation disparities were determined from quantitative monocular orientation tuning curves for 74 binocularly activated striate cells (37 simple, 3 hypercomplex I, 31 complex, 3 hypercomplex II) from nine cats. Without exception, the mean optimal stimulus orientation disparity in each of our animals showed a departure from zero disparity equivalent to an incyclorotation of the eyes (mean, 9.2 degrees; range, 2.7 degrees-15.9 degrees). 4. We attribute this mean optimal stimulus orientation disparity shift to ocular cyclorotation as a result of the initial anesthesia and paralysis. Assuming equal intortion, incyclorotation for each eye averages 4.6 degrees. On the assumption that the mean optimal stimulus orientation disparity is zero in normal life, we pooled results from the nine animals about their individual means. For the 74 cells the resulting distribution of the optimal stimulus orientation disparities had a range of about +/-15 degrees (simple cells: SD 4.9 degrees; complex cells: SD 7.4 degrees). 5. We examined the relationship of the sharpness of the orientation tuning curves to ocular dominance, to absolute orientation preference, and to other unit properties. The striking observation was the high correlation between the sharpness of orientation tuning curves for the two eyes of a binocular neuron. For simple cells the mean difference for the half-widths of half-height was only 2.54 degrees, with sharpness showing a high correlation between the two eyes (r=0.915) over half-width at half-heights ranging from 8.5 degrees to 41.8 degrees. Complex cells showed a similar, albeit weaker, correlation. 6. Having shown that, assessed monocularly binocular units show different orientation tunings in the two eyes, we undertook binocular experiments to ascertain if these differences were the optimal disparities of sharply tuned stimulus orientation disparity channels. Using a matrix stimulation paradigm to minimize the effects of spontaneous changes in responsiveness, we have simultaneously extracted bionocular stimulus orientation disparity and position disparity tuning curves from single striate neurons...", "references": []},

Nearly all cortical neurons studied received input from both eyes. Binocular neurons were classifiedLint two categories on the basis of their monocular responses: those that gave similar responses to stimulation of right and left eye (ocular balance) and those that gave different responses (ocular unbalance). Different kinds of binocular interactions were observed. 3. Most neurons (84%) were sensitive to location of the stimulus in depth. Four types of depth-sensitive cells were recognized: a) tuned excitatory neurons, the most common type, that gave excitatory responses over a narrow range of depth about the fixation distance often with inhibitory flanks nearer and farther, and that typically received a balanced binocular input; b) tuned inhibitory neurons whose responses were largely suppressed by stimuli at or close to the plane of fixation; c) near neurons, which responded well to stimuli in front of the fixation plane and were suppressed by those behind it; d) far neurons, the opposite of near neurons. The last three types of depth cells were usually ocularly unbalanced. Peaks and steps of depthsensitivity profiles occurred at or close to the fixation distance (within t 0.4O of disparity), whereas the total range of binocular interaction, even for a single cell, could extend to more than t lo of disparity. 4.

Spatial summation within cat retinal receptive fields was studied by recording from optic-tract fibres the responses of ganglion cells to grating patterns whose luminance perpendicular to the bars varied sinusoidally about the mean level. 2. Summation over the receptive fields of some cells (X-cells) was found to be approximately linear, while for other cells (Y-cells) summation was very non-linear. 3. The mean discharge frequency of Y-cells (unlike that of X-cells) was greatly increased when grating patterns drifted across their receptive fields. 4. In twenty-one X-cells the relation between the contrast and spatial frequency of drifting sinusoidal gratings which evoked the same small response was measured. In every case it was found that the reciprocal of this relation, the contrast sensitivity function, could be satisfactorily described by the difference of two Gaussian functions. 5. This finding supports the hypothesis that the sensitivities of the antagonistic centre and surround summating regions of ganglion cell receptive fields fall off as Gaussian functions of the distance from the field centre. 6. The way in which the sensitivity of an X-cell for a contrast-edge pattern varied with the distance of the edge from the receptive field centre was determined and found to be consistent with the cell's measured contrast sensitivity function. 7. Reducing the retinal illumination produced changes in the contrast sensitivity function of an X-cell which suggested that the diameters of the summating regions of the receptive field increased while the surround region became relatively ineffective.", "references": ["Optical-and-retinal-factors-affecting-visual-Campbell-Green/65a82b5b1fa2df805af22235aa7c6daacca18d2f", "Analysis-of-receptive-fields-of-cat-retinal-cells.-Rodieck-Stone/6043328ab66ae1deb57f124a19e93f2d6ffdff28", "Spatial-vision.-Boynton/8d43f89c69742529c37e3b7f45127e7fe1d2f419", "Cat-retinal-ganglion-cell-dendritic-fields.-Brown-Major/c9348c5c434e2ab179798177bd8b9c62ac38b430", "Directionally-selective-movement-detectors-in-the-Cooper-Robson/f5aa5c580b40e043ef814da6756779fcd0b571e9", "Retinal-Ganglion-Cells-Responding-Selectively-to-of-Barlow-Hill/81a9545a3731915ce92e6f6769153c2106929df2", "The-Distribution-of-Light-in-an-Image-formed-in-the-Morris-Marriott/a5ec4f1c74aac41c7974225861a1037a5366048c", "Receptive-fields-of-optic-nerve-fibres-in-the-Hubel-Wiesel/b0b13465c36789ebd0751178c5403efd4dd390b9"]},

Hubel", "Torsten N. Wiesel"], "date": "1967", "abstract": "IN HIGHER MAMMALS the left half of the visual field is represented in the right visual cortex, and the right half in the left cortex. The fact that our visual fields appear uniform, with no obvious interruption along the vertical midline, would seem to call for connections linking the two hemispheres. The present paper deals with the physiological properties of some of these connections. In the cat the vertical midline of the visual field has its primary representation in and close to the poorly defined boundary between areas 17 and 18 (7, 10). Each half-visual field is represented in both 17 and 18 in mirror fashion, so that as one proceeds away from the 17-18 boundary in either direction, medially along 17 or laterally along 18, the corresponding region of visual fields moves outward from the vertical meridian into the contralateral visual field. Recent anatomical evidence indicates that the part of area 17 adjacent to the 17-18 boundary sends callosal projections to the other hemisphere, ending in 18 near the 17-18 boundary (2,7,8) and possibly also in the adjacent part of 17 (8). Thus the parts of 17 and 18 having to do with the vertical midline of the visual fields are apparently connected on the two sides by the corpus callosum. In contrast, the more medial parts of 17, representing the peripheral parts of the visual fields, seem not to be reciprocally interconnected, and indeed one would hardly expect that cells concerned with a particular part of the left visual field should be connected specifically to cells concerned with the corresponding region in the right field. These anatomical findings have lately been confirmed in the elegant physiological experiments of Choudhury, Whitteridge, and Wilson (1). They showed that with one opti c trac t cut responses to light could be evoked in the ipsilateral hemisphere only near the 17-18 border, and only when the stimulus was applied near the vertical meridian. The responses were abolished either by cooling the corresponding region in the contralateral hemisphere or by cooling or cutting the posterior corpus callosum. Several lines of evidence thus indicate that fibers in the corpus callosum originating in the most lateral part of 17 and projecting to 18 on the other side have special functions involving the vertical midline of the visual field.", "references": ["The-naso-temporal-division-of-the-cat's-retina.-Stone/838435b5e61b762c6b8d76b5f26e66e60a0caa50", "Distribution-of-corpus-callosum-and-anterior-in-cat-Ebner-Myers/5420bc93fd0f683105fc760dd5437921532310e1", "Receptive-Fields-and-Functional-Architecture-in-Two-Hubel-Wiesel/f70c54029c17f50914996c834930ecbfacda195f", "The-Function-of-the-Callosal-Connections-of-the-Choudhury-Whitteridge/dd77aa1270d3a2f00a5eee9a72183bb18bcc1cb1", "Receptive-fields%2C-binocular-interaction-and-in-the-Hubel-Wiesel/6b4fe4aa4d66fecc7b2869569002714d91d0b3f7", "Integrative-action-in-the-cat's-lateral-geniculate-Hubel-Wiesel/39b1e0cfe086027ccad188659454972f84c78822", "Single-unit-activity-in-lateral-geniculate-body-and-Hubel/401185a7ba67af1e01e5278932747e5fd777d3a6", "Receptive-fields-of-single-neurones-in-the-cat's-Hubel-Wiesel/6f20e254e3993538c79e0ff2b9b8f198d3359cb3"]},

We also saw that for non-analytic data the series did not have to converge to a solution.

A typical setting where this becomes useful is the following. Consider a region \u03a9 = \u03a91\u222a\u03a92 separated by a curve \u0393. Suppose u satisfies a linear PDE Pu = 0 in \u03a9, and suppose also that you know that u = 0 in \u03a91. Does this mean that u = 0 in all of \u03a9? In the analytical class, this is the well-known unique-continuation principle. But this does not prevent smooth non-zero solutions to exist! You will see examples in the exercises.", "references": []},

It was found that an occipital evoked potential can be elicited in the human by moving a grating pattern without changing the mean light flux entering the eye. Prolonged viewing of a high contrast grating reduces the amplitude of the potential evoked by a low contrast grating.2. This adaptation to a grating was studied psychophysically by determining the contrast threshold before and after adaptation. There is a temporary fivefold rise in contrast threshold after exposure to a high contrast grating of the same orientation and spatial frequency.3. By determining the rise of threshold over a range of spatial frequency for a number of adapting frequencies it was found that the threshold elevation is limited to a spectrum of frequencies with a bandwidth of just over an octave at half amplitude, centred on the adapting frequency.4. The amplitude of the effect and its bandwidth are very similar for adapting spatial frequencies between 3 c/deg. and 14 c/deg. At higher frequencies the bandwidth is slightly narrower. For lower adapting frequencies the peak of the effect stays at 3 c/deg.5. These and other findings suggest that the human visual system may possess neurones selectively sensitive to spatial frequency and size. The orientational selectivity and the interocular transfer of the adaptation effect implicate the visual cortex as the site of these neurones.6. This neural system may play an essential preliminary role in the recognition of complex images and generalization for magnification.", "references": ["Adaptation-to-spatial-stimuli.-Blakemore-Campbell/31714de578775cf9c21f51e2aa61e519cc8e8367", "Cerebral-potentials-evoked-in-man-by-pattern-and-in-Cobb-Ettlinger/c5dc4e8c48c400e9489b5346d5029fe6408033ea", "The-spatial-selectivity-of-the-visual-cells-of-the-Campbell-Cooper/bfeca5b45b3cc6b39b04128d966f88e2a52e8985", "Visibility-of-aperiodic-patterns-compared-with-that-Campbell-Carpenter/6fbdf3584008d5ca1b1ea23bee16bb5b07778327", "Application-of-Fourier-analysis-to-the-visibility-Campbell-Robson/ddc2ea63fa69eca4aa44a4fd135543d67badcb23", "Cerebral-potentials-evoked-in-man-by-pattern-and-in-Cobb-Ettlinger/95e0e14921afd6ebe7884ad8b15ecb2f192ac39b", "Orientation-specific-effects-of-patterns-of-light-Gilinsky/c5d46a01ead90698fe7d9b14714f4b90ae2c9124", "Receptive-fields-and-functional-architecture-of-Hubel-Wiesel/1116467d67f475d1bd2539862f10f792032fe13b"]},

Based on both psychophysical and neurophysiological evidence, it was decided that an appropriate class of patterns would be those with a linearly varying spatial wavelength. Thresholds were measured both for patterns in which the spatial wavelength increased linearly with eccentricity and for patterns in which it decreased linearly with eccentricity. The results demonstrate that spatial inhomogeneity is indeed an important factor in the threshold visibility of gratings. The data support medium bandwidth estimates for the mechanisms underlying spatial frequency selectivity, and they are inconsistent with the notion that the visual system Performs a Fourier analysis of visual images. The data can be fit quantitatively by a semi-empirical model which postulates that the sensitivity to all spatial frequencies is highest in the fovea, but that the sensitivity to high frequencies declines more rapidly than that to low frequencies with increasing eccentricity. A comparison of the model with measured line spread functions permits some estimates to be made of the range of receptive field sires present at each eccentricity.", "references": []},

In addition, the time derivative delta[delta 2G(x,y) * I(x,y)]/delta t is measured at the zero crossings, and serves to constrain the local direction of motion to within 180 degrees.

One type, the opposed movement complex and opposed movement hypercomplex cells, responded to two edges at a given orientation moving towards or away from each other within the receptive fields. These cells were driven either monocularly or binocularly, but when binocularly driven the cells responded in an identical manner to stimulation of each eye, thus suggesting that such cells must receive a double, and opposed, input from each eye. The other type of cell, always binocularly driven, responded to movement in opposite directions on the two retinas, thus suggesting that such cells must receive diametrically opposite connexions from the two eyes.3. Long penetrations made to study the manner in which such cells were grouped together in the cortex revealed that they were arranged in small groups or clusters, separated from each other by the common directionally selective cells so prominently present in this area.

Anatomical studies have shown the cortex of the posterior bank of the superior temporal sulcus to receive a projection from visual cortical areas, including areas 17, 18 and 19. In this paper the response of single neurones in this area to simple visual stimulation is reported. Ten monkeys were studied.2. A clear but relatively crude topographic representation of the visual field was found. There was a large variation in the size of the receptive fields of individual cells, even in a single penetration. Some cells, with the central parts of their receptive fields located from between 1 and 5 degrees from the centre of gaze had receptive fields averaging about 10 degrees x 10 degrees or even larger. Other cells with central receptive fields had much smaller field sizes.3. Two main types of neurones were encountered, with subdivisions within each type. The first type responded to movement irrespective of form. These could be subdivided into neurones which responded to movement in any direction within the receptive field and neurones which responded to movement in one direction only (directionally selective neurones). Another type of cell was responsive to both contour and movement, much like the complex and lower order hypercomplex cells. Almost all such neurones were directionally selective.4. In oblique penetrations through this cortical region, there tended frequently to be an orderly shift in preferred directions of motion, thus suggesting the possibility of a columnar organization for movement.5.

Gratings of complex wave form cannot be distinguished from sine-wave gratings until their contrast has been raised to a level at which the higher harmonic components reach their independent threshold.5. These findings can be explained by the existence within the nervous system of linearly operating independent mechanisms selectively sensitive to limited ranges of spatial frequencies.", "references": ["Optical-quality-of-the-human-eye.-Campbell-Gubisch/db1cd81e2c54a0de7dc85519ac47aa0932fcbde7", "The-contrast-sensitivity-of-retinal-ganglion-cells-Enroth-Cugell-Robson/bc8dbc516e165cb4cc33854561024cec4530f357", "The-contrast-sensitivity-of-retinal-ganglion-cells-ENROTH-CUGELL-ROBSON/7e86da5f25091bd3e300bbdf117fad6d9ceb9882", "Optical-and-retinal-factors-affecting-visual-Campbell-Green/65a82b5b1fa2df805af22235aa7c6daacca18d2f", "Sine-wave-response-of-the-visual-system.-I.-The-LOWRY-DEPALMA/9c6b7a4cb780d5a6b28ff04cdf739db4c7fe5b7a", "Optical-and-photoelectric-analog-of-the-eye.-SCHADE/7c037d68ce6223dd6fb3a7769b5691db8ca99ea8"]},

To begin to understand it requires a knowledge not only of the topographic organization of the transcallosal prestriate projections themselves, a task which is rendered somewhat difficult by the complexity of the gyral and sulca[ pattern in this region, but also of the manner in which this projection system is related to the representation of visual fields in the prestriate cortex. In addition, an explanation of the nature of interhemispheric interaction requires an account of the more intimate anatomy of this system in terms of the laminar distribution of callosal fibers as well as their mode of termination in relation to cell parts and cell types. Recently, an anatomical account was given of the representation of visual fields in prestriate cortex of monkey 16. In that study, the interhemispheric connections of a restricted portion of the prestriate cortex were also examined. It appeared that those regions of prestriate cortex to which areas of midline representation (vertical meridian including the fovea) in striate cortex project, also receive a projection from the opposite hemisphere via the splenium of the corpus callosum4, TM. However, the use of the single survival time of 9 days in that study 16, and of relatively long survival times in other studies4, 9 has not allowed a study of the shifting patterns of degeneration in regard to characteristics and relative densities, nor of the laminar distribution, of the degenerating callosal fibers at different survival times. In addition, previously only a restricted portion of prestriate cortex was studied after splenial section and, since the sections were taken at millimeter intervals, a careful study of the relationship of the degenerating fields was not possible. This was particularly the case in the region of the annectant gyri of the lunate sulcus and the region at which the lunate and inferior occipital sulci co-exist and the superior temporal sulcus bends increasingly anteriorly.

There are classes of problems for which each of these methods is the most efficient. In this paper, we describe a variant of the discrete Newton algorithm which requires fewer operat ions than the standard method when n > 39. If a precondit ioned form of the matrix of second derivatives has many multiple or clustered eigenvalues, this can be exploited, and even greater efficiency can be achieved. Storage is of O(n) rather than the O(n 2) of the standard discrete Newton method, and this method requires less storage if n > 12.

Straightened 127 \u03bcm-diameter tungsten wires are etched to sharp points in KNO2 solution. The sharpened wires are insulated by collapsing borosilicate-glass capillaries onto them in a horizontal pipette puller. A novel technique is described for the removal of insulation from electrode tips by embedding them in a softened bead of solder glass. The bead is then allowed to cool, producing clean fractures of the borosilicate glass at the surface of the bead; the bare, undamaged tip of the electrode is then withdrawn. Electrodes with bare tips from 2 \u03bcm to more than 100 \u03bcm can be prepared with this method. Finally, the tips are plated with a gold cyanide solution and platinum black. The finished electrodes have tapers of less than 2\u00b0 and yet are extremely strong. Electrodes with conical plated tips 20 \u03bcm long by 6 \u03bcm diameter have 1 kHz impedances of less than 1 M\u03a8. Des m\u00e9thodes pratiques pour la construction de micro\u00e9lectrodes en tungst\u00e8ne sont d\u00e9crites en d\u00e9tail.

Une technique nouvelle pour retirer l'isolant des pointes d'\u00e9lectrodes en les ensevelissant dans une bille de verre au sodium ramolli est d\u00e9crite. La bille en se refroidissant produit une rupture nette du verre au borosilicate au niveau de la bille; la pointe d\u00e9nud\u00e9e et non endommag\u00e9e de l'\u00e9lectrode est alors retir\u00e9e.

Les pointes sont enfin plaqu\u00e9es dans une solution de cyanure d'or et au noir de platine. Les \u00e9lectrodes ainsi finies ont un angle de pointe de moins de 2\u00b0 et sont pourtant extr\u00e8mement robustes.

When estimating k singular values at the same time, the cost of one step of our generalized scheme on an n n matrix is O(nk).

From this study, later confirmed by Daniel and Whitteridge 6, it appeared that the vertical meridian of the lower and upper visual fields is represented at the striate prestriate boundary behind the lunate and above the inferior occipital sulci respectively with the foveal representation occupying a circular area below the tip of the lunate sulcus and the representation of the horizontal meridian extending backwards from the 'foveal cortex' (see Fig. 10). Since that time the projections of the striate cortex have been studied by Myers lz and by Kuypers et al. 9. Although in both studies the Nauta staining technique was used, the results obtained are not strictly in accord 19. The many disagreements over the anatomy, extent and functions of the prestriate cortex in the monkey have been reviewed at length elsewhere 19. Here it is sufficient to point out that the disagreements have not only been interdisciplinary but also intradisciplinary. For example, among students of cytoarchitectonics, Lashley and Clark 10 and, to a lesser extent, yon Bonin and Bailey 1 were not able to confirm the subdivision into the areas 18 and 19 proposed by Brodmann ~. Lashley and Clark concluded from their architectonic work that the areas 18 and 19 of Brodmann 3 could not be told apart and that, together with the area 7, they should be considered a single functional area. Von Bonin and Bailey 1 conceded that differences in cytoarchitecture may exist but disagreed with Brodmann 3 on the distinguishing cytoarchitectonic criteria and also found the differences to be too gradual and too 'subtle' to justify subdivision into 2 distinct fields. And although they did propose a subdivision into the 2 fields OA and OB, they were unable to clearly specify the boundary between these 2 fields or the anterior boundary of OA, the authors not being able to find any striking cytoarchitectonic differences posterior to the temporal pole.", "references": ["Projections-from-the-lateral-geniculate-nucleus-in-Wilson-Cragg/5edfe6c0af62f183999ff6b5103002755f8a9b50", "Two-methods-for-selective-silver-impregnation-of-in-Fink-Heimer/597e020348bc346ca5cd439aba03714aa99a8f18", "Receptive-Fields-and-Functional-Architecture-in-Two-Hubel-Wiesel/f70c54029c17f50914996c834930ecbfacda195f", "Projection-of-the-Retina-on-to-Striate-and-Cortex-Cowey/d066b941eb6730e8e886bb9914ab9211f457b461", "Commissural-connections-between-occipital-lobes-of-Myers/35e015388ab41f892cc0012e9250443e7d068422"]},

Foley", "Ted H. Applebaum", "W. A. Richards"], "date": "1975", "abstract": "Depth discrimination and perceived depth magnitude (indicated by a manual pointing response) were studied for disparities from 0.Y to 8\u201d. For briefly exposed targets. discrimination and depth magnitude yield somewhat different functions of disparity. Discrimination begins to decline when depth magnitude is still increasing. This suggests that the variance of the depth signal increases faster than the magnitude of the signal. This result is consistent with the notion that stereoscopic processing involves the pooling of the activity of disparity detectors. The phenomenon of stereoscopic vision has long been an actively researched subject. Most of the studies have been concerned with small disparities for which fusion occurs. It has long been known that disparities as large as several degrees which cannot be fused, nevertheless can give rise to an impression of depth (Ogle, 1952). It has also been known that as disparity increases there is a limit beyond which depth no longer increases and eventually a second limit beyond which depth can no longer be seen. Very few studies have been devoted to determining the properties of stereopsis with large disparities. We believe that these properties are important as clues to the processes involved in stereoscopic vision. Facts about large disparity stereopsis have played an important role in suggesting the hypothesis that perceived depth may depend on a process in which the outputs from many disparity detectors are pooled with perceived depth depending on the relative activity in a small number of such pools (Richards 1971). As we have argued elsewhere both the gradual decline in perceived depth at large disparities (Foley and Richards, 1972) and the existence of partial stereoblindness or stereoanomaly (Richards, 1970, 1971) suggest this interpretation. Most experiments with large disparities have been concerned with either one of two variables: (1) the maximum disparity at which depth is seen (Ogle, 1964; Westheimer and Tanzman, 1956; Blakemore, 1970; Richards and Foley, 1971); and (2) the magnitude of the depth sensation elicited by a given disparity (Foley and Richards, 1972). There are only three observers, two of them stereoanomalous, on which both kinds of measures have been reported. One might expect that discriminability and the magnitude of perceived depth would be very closely related so that the greater the perceived depth the greater the discriminability. This is not always the case, however. For anomalous observers a large depth sensation can sometimes be elicited although discrimination among different disparities is not possible (Richards. 1971). Consequently. we have no a priori assurance that the magnitude of the depth sensation is a reliable indicator of the observer\u2019s ability to discriminate among different disparities. We cannot even be assured that when stereoscopic discrimination is greatest then the depth sensation will also be the greatest. This report compares these two measures of stereoscopic information processing.", "references": []},

K. Hartline"], "date": "1959", "abstract": "The inhibition that is exerted mutually among receptor units (ommatidia) of the compound eye of Limulus is less for units widely separated than for those close together. This diminution of inhibition with distance is the resultant of two factors: (1) the threshold of inhibitory action increases with increasing distance between the units involved; and (2) the coefficient of inhibitory action decreases with increasing distance. The discharge of nerve impulses from ommatidia at various distances from one another may be described quantitatively by a set of simultaneous linear equations which express the excitatory effects of the illumination on each ommatidium and the inhibitory interactions between each ommatidium and its neighbors. The values of the thresholds and coefficients of inhibitory action, which appear as parameters in these equations, must be determined empirically: their dependence on distance is somewhat irregular and cannot yet be expressed in an exact general law. Nevertheless the diminution of inhibitory influences with distance is sufficiently uniform that patterns of neural response generated by various patterns of illumination on the receptor mosaic can be predicted qualitatively. Such predictions have been verified experimentally for two simple patterns of illumination: an abrupt step in intensity, and a simple gradient between two levels of intensity (the so-called Mach pattern). In each case, transitions in the pattern of illumination are accentuated in the corresponding pattern of neural response.", "references": ["Neural-interaction-in-the-eye-and-the-integration-Ratliff-Miller/c2378f2a03d78e2dbf805e68336335f8bfb1f137", "Spatial-Summation-of-Inhibitory-Influences-in-the-Hartline-Ratliff/5f655c2beb01bbed08908f8bffe776879a93e4bb", "Change-of-organization-in-the-receptive-fields-of-Barlow-Fitzhugh/929f33d2c4ede915b830e5a47b5007cd4c870386", "Inhibitory-Interaction-of-Receptor-Units-in-the-Eye-Hartline-Ratliff/46475ba5e2d1bcfce0a56a2943ae6a55be6edf8a"]},

Singleand multiunit activity was recorded from fovea1 striate neurons in six hemispheres of three rhesus monkeys trained to maintain fixation of a small luminous spot superimposed on patterned backgrounds. 2. Ongoing multiunit activity was monitored throughout all penetrat;bns, and a region of sustained high-frequency discharge was consistently encountered. Histological reconstructions revealed that this region was coextensive with layer IVc. 3. In a sample of 369 neurons, 283 were activated by square-wave gratings. Of those activated, 85% were sensitive to the orientation of gratings, and of those sensitive to orientation, 25% were sensitive to direction of movement. 4. The responses to moving gratings of 177 neurons were analyzed from interspike intervals collected by computer during the presentation of gratings of different spatial frequencies. From these responses, most cells could be identified as \u201cmodulated\u201d or \u201cfusional .\u201d The discharge patterns of modulated cells reflected the temporal frequency of luminance change at all effective spatial frequencies. Fusional cell responses, in contrast, showed little or no temporal modulation at any but the lowest spatial frequencies tested.

Eric L. Grimson"], "date": "1981", "abstract": "Recently, Marr & Poggio (1979) presented a theory of human stereo vision. An implementation of that theory is presented, and consists of five steps. (i) The left and right images are each filtered with masks of four sizes that increase with eccentricity; the shape of these masks is given by delta 2G, the Laplacian of a Gaussian function. (ii) Zero crossings in the filtered images are found along horizontal scan lines. (iii) For each mask size, matching takes place between zero crossings of the same sign and roughly the same orientation in the two images, for a range of disparities up to about the width of the mask's central region. Within this disparity range, it can be shown that false targets pose only a simple problem. (iv) The output of the wide masks can control vergence movements, thus causing small masks to come into correspondence. In this way, the matching process gradually moves from dealing with large disparities at a low resolution to dealing with small disparities at a high resolution. (v) When a correspondence is achieved, it is stored in a dynamic buffer, called the 2 1/2-dimensional sketch. To support the adequacy of the Marr-Poggio model of human stereo vision, the implementation was tested on a wide range of stereograms from the human stereopsis literature. The performance of the implementation is illustrated and compared with human perception. Also statistical assumptions made by Marr & Poggio are supported by comparison with statistics found in practice. Finally, the process of implementing the theory has led to the clarification and refinement of a number of details within the theory; these are discussed in detail.", "references": ["Vision-and-resolution-in-the-central-retina.-O'brien/3dad2cb7138817c2f5f377269bedae396ffe0018", "Smallest-channel-in-early-human-vision.-Marr-Poggio/eb351ebb9bc88f0af622f576ca19ea7cb841d958", "Theory-of-edge-detection.-Marr-Hildreth/f62fbec04ed3a4625a1bc4e83e6766e9b74673cc", "A-computational-theory-of-human-stereo-vision.-Marr-Poggio/fafd813987f868fbbd904520a68607166c66ea85", "A-four-mechanism-model-for-threshold-spatial-vision-Wilson-Bergen/b45c9da1e49cce9f37976d9187f85fb217d8d092", "Texture-contours-can-facilitate-stereopsis-by-eye-Kidd-Frisby/5680fe48e94d5de3cadadb1b164e1f4eab87739e", "Representation-and-recognition-of-the-spatial-of-Marr-Nishihara/bdf9b8f4de001f5f37bc844efbce1210d581d599", "Stereopsis-masking-in-humans-is-not-orientationally-Mayhew-Frisby/610f31e1fa57a0f8768a239acaa06d02758458ee"]},

Yet, it was long known as a field not entirely easy to grasp for a newcomer, whether he or she was a research student or a control engineer in industry. This may seem surprising, since the basic ideas behind the first adaptive controllers were fairly simple and intuitively appealing. The sensitivity arguments of the so called MIT rule is an example, and in the revised form of Parks (1966) they were put on an analytically sound basis by using stability results by Lyapunov. Parks' results were generalized in different directions in the 1970s by Monopoli and others. During this period it was not easy to filter out the essence of the great variety of Model Reference Adaptive Systems (MRAS) that were presented in the literature. This may be a reason why some of the fundamental stability results were not settled until late in the 1970s. Meanwhile, the MRAS concepts were carried over to sampled data systems, for which a parallel development was underway. The self-tunin~ regulator (STR), presented in the important paper by Astr6m and Wittenmark (1973), was based on a separation between identification and control design, a powerful concept that lead to many different algorithms. Late in the 1970s, a fruitful crossfertilization between the MRAS and the self-tuning regulators took place. With the beginning of the 1980s, an exciting period in the adaptive control research began. A critical reconsideration of the adaptive controllers was initiated by Rohrs et al. (1982). The algorithms, in most cases analysed under ideal assumptions, were shown to have undesirable properties in realistic situations with, e.g. disturbances and unmodeled dynamics present. As a result, a new wealth of algorithms were suggested and analysed in the literature, and once again the field of adaptive control offered a challenge for everyone trying to assimilate the fundamental ideas and concepts. Adaptive Control Stability, Convergence. and Robustness appears at a time when the field starts to show some maturity, so that basic ideas, concepts and principles can be communicated with credibility. The authors of the book intend \"to give, in a concise and unified fashion, the major results, techniques of analysis and new directions of research in adaptive systems\". With a general background in control systems and in linear systems theory, the book could serve well as the text for a one-semester graduate course. However, the focus is definitely on theoretical analysis. It is therefore likely that an industrial practitioner will find the material too hard to digest. This is emphasized by the absence of numerical examples in several chapters and by the very brief discussions on practical considerations. The authors' choice to treat only continuous time algorithms is also evidence that applications are not of primary concern. The introductory chapter gives a very nice background from the academic viewpoint. Historical remarks are nicely mixed with the introduction of the MRAS and STR ideas. Together with the chapter on mathematical preliminaries, it gives a good start. The view of adaptive control as the aggregation of a", "references": []},

All the cells (158) that we studied in the lateral geniculate nuclei of Macaca nemestrina and Macaca irus could be distinguished as either X-like or Y-like on the basis of their responses to tests developed to classify cat retinal and lateral geniculate nucleus cells. These tests include responses to stationary spots, fast moving wands and moving gratings. 2. Response latencies to electrical stimulation of the optic chiasm were determined for 130 cells; no X-like cell showed a latency shorter than 1-7 ms, no Y-like cell showed a latency longer than 1-6 ms. Primate lateral geniculate nucleus cells with X-like properties thus receive their excitatory input from retinal cells with slowly conducting axons and these most probably include the tonic ganglion cells described by Gouras (1968, 1969); Y-like lateral geniculate nucleus cells are driven by retinal cells with faster conducting axons, most probably including the phasic ganglion cells described by Gouras. 3. Wiesel & Hubel (1966) classified monkey lateral geniculate nucleus cells into four main types based on their receptive-field properties, as revealed by spectrally and spatially distinct stimuli. We find that all Type I and Type II cells show X-like properties; all type IV cells show Y-like properties. Type III consists of a subtype that show X-like properties, here termed Type IIIx, and a subtype that show Y-like properties, here termed Type IIIy. 4. The first cells encountered as the micro-electrode reached the lateral geniculate nucleus were always X-like. In some penetrations only X-like cells were encountered as the electrode moved downward through the lateral geniculate nucleus. In the remaining penetrations, after recording X-like cells through most of the lateral geniculate nucleus, Y-like cells were then encountered. No X-like cells were found below Y-like cells. thus these two classes of cells are anatomically segregated within the primate lateral geniculate nucleus. Electrode marking showed the borger between X-like and Y-like cells to correspond to the border between the paro- and magnocellular layers of the lateral geniculate nucleus. Thus X-like cells (i.e. Types I, II and IIIx) occur in the parvocellular layers, Y-like cells (i.e. Types IIIy and IV)in the magnocellular layers.", "references": []},

The maxima of their frequency characteristics lie in the range of 0.3-5.0 c/deg and do not change under various modifications of experimental conditions. The response of the complex receptive fields to gratings of different spatial frequencies and single slits of different width can be predicted from the spatial frequency characteristics of these stimuli. The complex receptive fields may have, in addition to a main maximum and a low frequency band-pass region, an additional maximum. The complex receptive fields have several centers of discharge. It is suggested that these complex receptive fields are neurophysiological correlates of spatial-frequency channels revealed in many psychophysical experiments. Following the work of Campbell and Robson (1964, 1968) there appeared a number of investigations (Blakemore and Campbell, 1969: Sachs, Nachmias and Robson, 1971; Graham and Nachmias, 1971; Sullivan, Georgeson and Oatley, 1972; Kulikowski. Abadi and King-Smith, 1973). showing the existence of independent spatial frequency channels in the visual system. These channels were assumed to perform the Fourier analysis of the image. Studies of the complex receptive fields in the visual cortex of the cat have suggested that these fields perform a generalised Fourier analysis over limited regions of the visual field (piecewise) (Glezer, 1970; Glezer, Ivanov and Tsherbach, 1972, 1973).

No two of the experiments referenced above employ exactly the same operations of physical measurement , and an essential communality between them is not easy to specify in objective terms. In the study reported here, ratings of the complexity of nonrepresenta-tional shapes were obtained from a large number of Ss and related to measurable physical characteristics of the shapes. The results not only have interest in their own right, but also serve to indicate the physical variables most likely to be relevant to other tasks, like those initially mentioned , on which data are typically harder to get and less precise.

METHOD Materials.-\u2014The stimuli were 72 \"random\" shapes, each constructed by the following general method. In a k X k matrix, n random points were plotted, i.e., all coordinates of the points were random numbers between 1 and k. The points were then connected randomly into a polygon of n sides. This connecting process involved two steps. First, peripheral points were connected into a convex polygon which enclosed all the points not included in its contour (as if a pin were stuck into each point and a rubber band snapped around the whole cluster). Second, the unconnected points were given a random order and each in turn was \"taken into\" a randomly chosen segment of the surrounding polygon (as if by hooking that segment of the rubber band over the interior pin). Since lines connecting the points were not permitted to cross, the number of alternative segments into which a given point might be taken could either increase or decrease as the process continued; hence the assignment of a random sequence to the unconnected points. Connections which placed certain points outside the polygon were permitted, though in consequence the ways in which such points could themselves be connected were restricted. Some of the polygons thus constructed were further developed into curved figures by replacing angles with inscribed arcs of random 221", "references": ["The-quantitative-study-of-shape-and-pattern-Arnoult-ATTNEAVE/0094175f4e0e341af2e045734664c9bd5404471d", "Symmetry%2C-information%2C-and-memory-for-patterns.-ATTNEAVE/052bd83c444649e455398d2ceb1c3d7ed4e1d42e", "Identification-of-dot-patterns-from-memory-as-a-of-French/97539b365ee219223f5df6b8b732e97d86583cc6", "Some-informational-aspects-of-visual-perception.-ATTNEAVE/6d0198460198fdb49b89d1646049712b3a0683df", "The-nomenclature-of-information-theory-MacKay/be88eabf755f85d5675a2d20de53ab10ae52f010", "A-method-of-graded-dichotomies-for-the-scaling-of-ATTNEAVE/bff24c27885c84c22f3d402190e6efd7858d6f1d"]},

Kidd", "John P. Frisby", "John E. W. Mayhew"], "date": "1979", "abstract": "IN man the two eyes receive slightly differing views of the world. The visual system utilises this disparity for stereoscopic depth perception. This involves a difficult correspondence problem for establishing binocular fusion: for each surface feature extracted from one eye's image, the brain has to decide which is the equivalent feature in the other eye's image. Ambiguities often exist, particularly for densely-textured visual surfaces, but one aspect of binocular visual processing which helps reduce the scale of the problem is that for any given vergence angle, the visual system considers only those potential left/right fusions with disparities under a certain limiting size (defined by Panum's fusional areas1,2). This disparity limit, however, requires that when disparities greater than Panum's area are presented, a suitable vergence change must be initiated to bring corresponding features within the allowable range for fusion. A question currently of considerable theoretical interest concerns the nature of the stimulus characteristics used to initiate these essential vergence movements. The interest stems mainly from Marr and Poggio's model of human stereo vision3,4 in which false correspondences are avoided by seeking left/right fusions within spatial frequency tuned disparity channels whose disparity range is closely tied to their spatial frequency sensitivity5. By setting the disparity range of any given channel to about \u00b1 w (where w = the width of the centre of the receptive fields of the channel in question) Marr and Poggio have demonstrated that false matches are improbable and any that do emerge are easily eliminated using quite simple rules. A further feature of the model is that the outputs of low spatial frequency tuned channels (that is units capable of dealing with large disparities because of their relatively large receptive fields) can initiate vergence movements bringing into correspondence higher spatial frequency channels mediating smaller disparities. The theory predicts that in the case of a two-planar densely-textured stereogram (for example Fig. 1a\u2013c] in which the disparity range exceeds the size appropriate for the lowest spatial frequency channels activated by the stereogram's texture, vergence movements should exhibit only a random-search structure. We report here an experimental test of this prediction which shows that vergence movements are not always random in the stimulus circumstances just specified. Rather, vergence can be guided by texture contours (Fig. 1b) depicted by differences of texture orientation between regions of relatively high spatial frequency content for the disparity range incorporated in the stereogram. Moreover, we find that such texture contours can facilitate stereopsis in a way consistent with the idea that they do so by initiating appropriate eye movements.", "references": []},

Various methods of echo control have been used for over 50 years but recent introduction of transmission delays in excess of 300 ms, over satellite circuits, has resulted in a general reexamination of suppression methods. This led to development of the echo canceller. Adaptive echo cancellation is accomplished by automatically synthesizing a replica of the echo path response, convolving the incoming signal with the replica and subtracting the resulting echo estimate from the echo path output. Transmission is not thereby interrupted in any way and two-way information transmission proceeds normally with little or no echo. Detailed mathematical formulations for the convergence properties of such devices allow understanding of the effects of various hardware configurations and input signal properties. Echo cancellers may be applied to the network in a number of ways and the development of a VLSI canceller chip promises inexpensive implementation of these applications.

It plays a big role in telecommunications as well, and in this paper, we will discuss how and why echo cancelers are becoming the dominant means to control echo in the telephone system [1,2]. Echo in the telephone system is generally undesirable but .unavoidable. Consider a typical toll call (Fig. 1) in which the transmission medium is a satellite link instead of wires. The local link from phone to central office is a bidirectional \u201ctwo-wire\u201d loop while the satellite link uses two separate unidirectional channels for \u201dfour-wire\u201d transmission. The use of separate channels for the two directions of transmission is a necessary characteristic of long distance transmission links. The conversion between the two-wire and four-wire parts of the overall transmission link is done in the device called a \u201chybrid\u201d. Ideally, a hybrid circuit couples all energy on the incoming branch of the four-wire circuit into the two-wire circuit, and none of the incoming four-wire signal should be transferred to the outgoing branch of the four-wire circuit. The hybrids do not operate perfectly, however, because of impedance mismatch problems.

A computationally feasible procedure is described which allows the accuracy requirements of the character recognizer to be relaxed if it is followed by a contextual postprocessor. The modified recognition system is allowed to output several alternatives for each character, while the postprocessor selects the proper string of characters by having access to both the dictionary and the dictionary syntax.

For stationary stochastic inputs, the mean-square error, the difference between the filter output and an externally supplied input called the \"desired response,\" is a quadratic function of the weights, a paraboloid with a single fixed minimum point that can be sought by gradient techniques. The gradient estimation process is shown to introduce noise into the weight vector that is proportional to the speed of adaptation and number of weights. The effect of this noise is expressed in terms of a dimensionless quantity \"misadjustment\" that is a measure of the deviation from optimal Wiener performance. Analysis of a simple nonstationary case, in which the minimum point of the error surface is moving according to an assumed first-order Markov process, shows that an additional contribution to misadjustment arises from \"lag\" of the adaptive process in tracking the moving minimum point. This contribution, which is additive, is proportional to the number of weights but inversely proportional to the speed of adaptation. The sum of the misadjustments can be minimized by choosing the speed of adaptation to make equal the two contributions. It is further shown, in Appendix A, that for stationary inputs the LMS adaptive algorithm, based on the method of steepest descent, approaches the theoretical limit of efficiency in terms of misadjustment and speed of adaptation when the eigenvalues of the input correlation matrix are equal or close in value. When the eigenvalues are highly disparate (\u03bbmax/\u03bbmin> 10), an algorithm similar to LMS but based on Newton's method would approach this theoretical limit very closely.", "references": ["Adaptive-noise-cancelling%3A-Principles-and-Widrow-Glover/04241bb9b14efd0933447c2dcaf19ffa58c953ae", "Linear-prediction%3A-A-tutorial-review-Makhoul/17423cc37eee7423423c03624f4a637b191eb998", "A-Rapidly-Converging-First-Order-Training-Algorithm-Schonfeld-Schwartz/b5fe0ec7ef71c79d3a02b3efb7f0af87d37990f2"]},

Our most precise knowledge of perception is in those areas which have yielded to psychophysical analysis (e.g., the perception of size, color, and pitch), but there is virtually no psychophysics of shape or pattern. Several difficulties may be pointed out at once: (a) Shape is a multidimensional variable, though it is often carelessly referred to as a \"dimension,\" along with brightness, hue, area, and the like, (b) The number of dimensions necessary to describe a shape is not fixed or constant, but increases with the complexity of the shape, (c) Even if we know how many dimensions are necessary in a given case, the choice of particular descriptive terms (i.e., of referenceaxes in the multidimensional space with which we are dealing) remains a problem; presumably some such terms have more psychological meaningfulness than others.", "references": ["Physical-determinants-of-the-judged-complexity-of-ATTNEAVE/1d671b87a0ec0553b73a84215d98c22c909afba3", "Stimulus-correlates-of-visual-pattern-recognition%3A-Fitts-Weinstein/6a032683bc6e175585ad744b617a5908b7c8623a", "Programming-pattern-recognition-Dinneen/e7269ba40686ddc3c38ff5240fe26fd2e829831b", "Symmetry%2C-information%2C-and-memory-for-patterns.-ATTNEAVE/052bd83c444649e455398d2ceb1c3d7ed4e1d42e", "Some-informational-aspects-of-visual-perception.-ATTNEAVE/6d0198460198fdb49b89d1646049712b3a0683df", "Threshold-for-visual-form%3A-a-diffusion-model.-Bitterman-Krauskopf/8a24b361c7931c4aa8f1b22547a310e6d0c2fa7b"]},

The number of taps which must be added depends on the degree of nonlinearity which must be compensated.

All languages exhibi t certain peculiar character is t ics such as let ter combinat ions, f requency of occurrence of let ters and init ial and terminal le t ters of words.

This fact leads one to believe t h a t using this and other techniques could dramat ical ly improve the abil i ty of character recognit ion methods to filter out noisy input and improve accuracy. There has been considerable work done recently in the field of using computers to recognize printed or typed characters [1, 2, 3]. To the authors' knowledge there has been little, if any, use of the fact that most written languages have certain letter patterns which occur often and that certain other patterns are unlikely. In fact, one observer comments that \"A certain recognition technique perhaps should be coupled with other procedures to obtain truly effective, easily in~plemented and reliable character recognition. The loss introduced by a mixed recognition system appears to be solely one of elegance\" [4]. Cryptographers, of course, have used their knowledge of letter patterns to considerable advantage in decoding secret messages. It is well known, for instance, that in English text the most frequently used letter is E and that the letter T is most often the first letter of a word. Many other facts are also known about combination of letters, frequency of letter occurrence, etc. Could not this knowledge be used as information to a cornputer to allow it to more accurately read a text consisting of alphabetic characters only? Some preliminary tests indicate that such a method would improve accuracy of character recognition systems. Most character recognition methods are affected by \"noise\" from poor printing, dirt on the paper and similar conditions. The computer is then faced with the problem of deciding if the input is due to actual data or extraneous information. The letter H might be easily distorted into an A or an R by noise in the input. In instances like these the human brain easily supplies the proper letter by using context. For instance, the word C-W must either be COW or CAW since none of the other letters in the alphabet result in proper English words. While it would no doubt be difficult to \"teach\" a computer enough facts to perform this type of reasoning, there is good data available on the occurrence of digraphs or combination of two letters in the conunon languages. There are available at least two tabulations which show the occurrence in English of the various letters of the alphabet taken two at a time [5, 6]. 465 Journal of the Association for Computing Machinery, Vol. 11, No. 4 (October, 1964), pp. 465-470 4 6 6 A.W.

M. Sondhi", "Debasis Mitra"], "date": "1976", "abstract": "We derive a broad range of theoretical results concerning the performance and limitations of a class of analog adaptive filters. Applications of these filters have been proposed in many different engineering contexts which have in common the following idealized identification problem: A system has a vector input x(t) and a scalar output z(t)=h'x(t), where h is an unknown time-invariant coefficient vector. From a knowledge of x(t) and z(t) it is required to estimate h. The filter considered here adjusts an estimate vector h^(t) in a control loop, thus d/dt h^= KF[z(t)-z^(t)]x(t) where z^(t) = h^'x(t), F is a suitable, in general nonlinear, function, and K is the loop gain. The effectiveness of the filter is determined by the convergence properties of the misalignment vector, r = h - h^. With weak nondegeneracy requirements on x(t) we prove the exponential convergence to zero of the norm ||r(t)||. For all values of K, we give upper and lower bounds on the convergence rate which are tight in that both bounds have similar qualitative dependence on K. The dependence of these bounds on K is unexpected and important since it reveals basic limitations of the filters which are not predicted by the conventional approximate method of analysis, the \"method of averaging.\" By analyzing the effects of an added forcing term u(t) in the control equation we obtain upper bounds to the effects on the convergence process of various important departures from the idealized model as when noise is present as an additional component of z(t), the coefficient vector h is time-varying, and the integrators in a hardware implementation have finite memory.", "references": ["Adaptive-Estimation-with-Mutually-Correlated-Daniell/4057c46c5d6b2a9b93a641f6adf3ca71dab1af9a"]},

Demytko", "K English"], "date": "1977", "abstract": "Echo cancellation is rapidly becoming a viable alternative to the conventional method of echo suppression currently in use to curtail echoes on long-distance telephone circuits. Echo suppressors introduce a switched loss into the return speech path when echo is present, and are inherently incapable of sustaining reduction of echo during periods of double-talk-while both parties are talking simultaneously. Echo cancellers use an adaptive filter to model the echo path, and compute a replica of the echo component present in the return speech signal. Subtraction of the replica from the return speech signal leaves it devoid of echo, allowing only the speech from the other party to be passed. Lack of synchronism in some classes of carrier system give rise to cyclic time variation in the echo path, termed \"phase-roll,\" which must be tracked by the adaptive filter. Established adaptive echo cancellers are ineffective on circuits exhibiting phase-roll rates in excess of 0.5 Hz. The nature of the phase-roll problem is examined and two solutions discussed; use of compensating frequency offsets and cancellers with high-speed convergence. A prototype capable of satisfactory performance with speech on circuits exhibiting phase-roll rates up to 1.8 Hz is described. Modifications are proposed whereby the performance attained on speech signals can be made to approach the observed 3.4 Hz phase-roll limit with random noise input.", "references": []},

Zeidler", "Jr. Eugene Dong", "R Goodlin"], "date": "1975", "abstract": "This paper describes the concept of adaptive noise cancelling, an alternative method of estimating signals corrupted by additive noise or interference. The method uses a \"primary\" input containing the corrupted signal and a \"reference\" input containing noise correlated in some unknown way with the primary noise. The reference input is adaptively filtered and subtracted from the primary input to obtain the signal estimate. Adaptive filtering before subtraction allows the treatment of inputs that are deterministic or stochastic, stationary or time variable. Wiener solutions are developed to describe asymptotic adaptive performance and output signal-to-noise ratio for stationary stochastic inputs, including single and multiple reference inputs. These solutions show that when the reference input is free of signal and certain other conditions are met noise in the primary input can be essentiany eliminated without signal distortion. It is further shown that in treating periodic interference the adaptive noise canceller acts as a notch filter with narrow bandwidth, infinite null, and the capability of tracking the exact frequency of the interference; in this case the canceller behaves as a linear, time-invariant system, with the adaptive filter converging on a dynamic rather than a static solution. Experimental results are presented that illustrate the usefulness of the adaptive noise cancelling technique in a variety of practical applications. These applications include the cancelling of various forms of periodic interference in electrocardiography, the cancelling of periodic interference in speech signals, and the cancelling of broad-band interference in the side-lobes of an antenna array. In further experiments it is shown that a sine wave and Gaussian noise can be separated by using a reference input that is a delayed version of the primary input. Suggested applications include the elimination of tape hum or turntable rumble during the playback of recorded broad-band signals and the automatic detection of very-low-level periodic signals masked by broad-band noise.", "references": ["Adaptive-linear-estimation-for-stationary-processes-Kim-Davisson/df782a6114bd4e09377facd07095e1e8ae576df3", "A-view-of-three-decades-of-linear-filtering-theory-Kailath/0379b3842e4d504fe0cc927bbaed67ccb64ef61f", "Computer-diagnosis-of-fetal-heart-rate-patterns.-Yeh-Betyar/115bb48d64993189d22d77bc52cb6c8370dee326", "Fetal-electrocardiography-with-cancellation-of-Walden-Birnbaum/2522c32cbad0556418641343a876c7cc1e11d082"]},

The author was with Stanford University, Palo Alto, Calif. He is now with the IBM Scientific Center, Houston, Tex. A generalized algorithm is defined for analytic purposes. It is demonstrated for this generalized algorithm that excess mean-square error (as defined by Widrow) can be made arbitrarily small for large values of time in the correlated case. The analysis can be applied to a particular estimation scheme of 1) the particular algorithm can be placed in the generalized form, and 2) the given assumptions are satisfied. The analysis of the generalized algorithm requires that the data vectors possess only a few properties ; foremnost among these are ergodicity and a form of asymptotic independence. This analysis does not assume any particular probability distribution function nor any particular form of mutual correlation for the data vectors.", "references": []},

The methods discussed here are useful in designing filter banks when the filter bank outputs are to be used for synthesis after multiplicative modifications are made to the spectrum. I N THIS paper, some practical and theoretical questions are considered concerning the analysis of and synthesis from a signal's short term spectrum. The short term spectrum, or time spectrum, are those signals which result from analyzing a single input signal with a set of filters which are selective over a range of frequencies [l]-[3]. In the case of analysis by a spectrum analyzer, the filters are either spaced contiguously or one filter is heterodyned over the frequency range of interest. For many applications, this is quite adequate. However , when one is interested in both analysis and synthesis, a more rigorous approach is in order. In this paper, we shall restrict ourselves to the case of uniformly spaced, symmetric bandpass filters. We are also not concerned with bandwidth reduction. In general, the channel capacity in the short term spectral domain will be greater than that of the original signal. We will be interested, however, in being able to modify the short term spectrum in either its phase or amplitude content without introducing undesired distortion in the synthesized signal. Previous filter bank analysis-synthesis techniques have been given and Portnoff [3]. Our approach differs in several important ways. Previous approaches have used contiguous filter banks in the analysis process. We shall show that this results in an undersampled spectrum and, as a result, synthesis becomes very sensitive to phase or delay modifications. We will then show that by using a properly sampled overlapping filter set, we may avoid this sensitivity. By recognizing the need for a greater number of filters, both the analysis and synthesis procedures are simplified. However, the number of samples of data in the short term spectral domain that results per sample of input data is greater than one; thus, the relevance of the present method to bandwidth reduction remains unclear. A second important difference between our approach and that of others is during synthesis. All previous authors [l]-[3] have summed the filter outputs for the synthesis; we synthesize in a way that is similar to the overlap add method [4]. As a result, our method \u2026", "references": []},

The hexagonal tessellation is preferred because it removes the connectivity ambiguity present in the square or checkerboard tessellation.

The general Golay transform creates a new binary image (the output image) from as many as three stacked input images. Simpler Golay transforms merely alter the binary pattern contained in a single image plane, i.e., the same plane acts as both input and output. Because it is slow and cumbersome to perform Golay transforms using a general-purpose computer, fast special-purpose computers have been built for this purpose which may be programmed in a new image processing language called Glol (Golay logic language). It has been found, using both synthetic images as well as images taken from the real world, that Golay transforms are useful in feature enhancement and extraction.

However, 1974 is also twenty-five years after the publication in the open literature of Wiener\u2019s famous monograph, \u201cExtrapolation, Interpolation and Smoothing of Stationary Time Series, with Engineering Applications\u201d [I], so that it is appropriate this year to commemorate this event as well. [As noted elsewhere in this issue, this month is also the tenth anniversary of Wiener\u2019s death (March 18, 1964).] Not only was this work the direct cause for the great activity of the last three decades in signal estimation, but it was perhaps the greatest factor in bringing the statistical point of view clearly into communication theory and also control theory. It may suffice to quote Shannon\u2019s own major acknowledgment: \u201cCredit should also be given to Professor N. Wiener, whose elegant solution of the problems of filtering and prediction of stationary ensembles has considerably influenced the writer\u2019s thinking in this field.\u201d The subject of estimation is a vast one, and most of our attention will be devoted to the particular problems of linear least-squares estimation, or linear Jiltering as it has generally come to be called in the engineering literature. Even though least-squares estimation is clearly only a small part of the possible forms of estimation theory, in the author\u2019s opinion it is perhaps the most interesting and most important part. Least-squares theory not only provides useful solutions to certain specific estimation problems, but it also has connections to and implications for a surprisingly large number of other problems, both statistical and deterministic.

Fuster"], "date": "1973", "abstract": "SINCE THE ORIGINAL investigations of Jacob-sen (22, 23) in primates, the granular cortex of the frontal lobe, also called pre-hontal cortex, has been thought to play a role in short-term memory. This is an inference from the deficits that lesions of this cortical region cause on performance of delayed-response tests. A delayed-response .llv consists of tl trial typica one of two possible visual tation of lc presen cues, xi ensuing period it, a ch of enforced delay and, oice of motor response i at the end n accord wi of th the cue. The temporal separation between cue and response is the principal element making the delayed-response procedure a test of an operationally defined short-term memory function. However, the neural processes i nvolvetl in delayed-response performance , as the psychological processes participating in short-term memory, are probably many and complex. The precise role of the prefrontal cortex in these is not yet clear. In contrast to the abundant documen ta-tion of the effects of frontal ablations, the literature 011 the neuroelectrical correlates of delayed-response behavior is brief and recent. In 1969, Stamm and Rosen (43) showed steady potential shifts in the cortex of monkeys during a delayed-response test. Their most significant finding was a slow negative potential on the surface of the l&frontal cortex at the beginning of the delay period, suggesting that at that time there is in that region an increase of neu-ronal excitability. Kubota and Niki (27) have more recently reported firing changes of units irl t 1~ periprincipal area of the llrefrontal cortex in relation to the performance of a delayed alternation task calling for successive alternate presses of two levers with interspersed 5see delays. Some units are more active immediately before lever-pressing than during the delays; others show the opposite pattern. A previous investigation showed that bilateral or unilateral cooling of the pre-frontal cortical convexity produces marked and reversible deficits of performance in animals trained at the direct-method version of the delayed-response test (16). It is because of these results that the same behav-ioral test was adopted for the present study: a microelectrode exploration of the pre-frontal cortex of the monkey performing the delayed-response task. To the three successive periods that corn stitute a single trial in the delayed-response task-cue period, delay, and response period-three fundamental processes of short-term memory function may be attributed: the acquisition, the retention, and the corollary use of information.

Several investigatorsa,3,v,9,12 have noted radioactive substances in the postsynaptic ceils, which suggests that these cells take up labeled material released from the terminals 1,3,7. Grafstein 4 was the first to explore the possibility of tracing a pathway beyond the terminals of the initially labeled cells, by examining also the projections of the recipient postsynaptic neurons. By radiochemical measurements and by autoradiog-raphy, it was shown that after injection of [3H]proline and [aH]fucose into one eye of a mouse the contralateral striate cortex was more heavily labeled than the ipsilateral, and that the label was concentrated in layer IV 5,14. In the macaque monkey the geniculostriate pathway terminates in a very dense, highly localized manner, mainly in layer IV C. Furthermore, projections from the 2 eyes end in a characteristic alternating stripe-like pattern of ocular-dominance columns s. It occurred to us that if radioactive substances were transported transneuronally, injection of labeled material into one eye followed by autoradiog-raphy of the cortex might reveal the entire system of ocular-dominance columns. For the autoradiographic study of transneuronal transport in the primate visual system, 50/~1 of a saline solution containing L-[6-3H]fucose (2.5 mCi/ml, 13.4Ci/ mmole) and L-[3H]proline (7.5 mCi/ml, generally labeled, 6.8 Ci/mmole) was injected into the vitreous of the left eye ofa 3 kg normal Rhesus macaque. This injection was repeated 5 times at 12 h intervals (total dose 3.0 mCi). The animal was perfused with 10 ~ formalin 3 weeks after the initial injection. The lateral geniculate nucleus was cut into 20 #m frozen sections, and the striate cortex was embedded in paraffin and cut into 15/~m sections. The sections were coated with Ilford K5 emulsion, left in the dark for 2-4 months and developed in Dektol. Sections were counter-stained with thionin. In the lateral geniculate nucleus all layers receiving projections from the injected eye were strongly labeled (Fig. l A and B). The other layers showed grain counts higher than background, perhaps partly because of fibers of passage from the retina,", "references": ["Axonal-migration-of-protein-and-glycoprotein-to-I.-Droz-K%C3%B6nig/db3b5111e75287f72cdadb962fe573a532a750ed", "Transport-of-radioactivity-from-eye-to-visual-in-Grafstein-Laureno/6bc96df83085dbf3a13f6d2a7b2d72307c0f7155", "A-retinohypothalamic-projection-in-the-rat.-Moore-Lenn/4e6573a79ea5a5a00650f7c042aa48615bf4239f", "Electron-microscopic-distribution-of-axoplasmic-Hendrickson/e377009332e5c76db846bf23fac269af807436eb", "Laminar-and-columnar-distribution-of-fibers-in-the-Hubel-Wiesel/e5f4f49721eb3f6bdba304a06728327631e832bb", "The-autoradiographic-demonstration-of-axonal-in-the-Cowan-Gottlieb/9e5f6bbae13e881c7d872be4c881adcd15d2d7ba", "Transfer-of-material-from-efferent-axons-to-sensory-%C3%81lvarez-P%C3%BCschel/2f3fb8d30e6072b5f7729f925d5eb5bb30baf7a7", "Transneuronal-transfer-of-radioactivity-in-the-Grafstein/a3eba7c7b439aee4c1f382fb118a07649a308d32", "Transport-of-s-100-protein-in-mammalian-nerve-and-Miani/f1683c5fcf68e9973b4c874df9f771748d59682a", "Electron-microscopic-radioautography%3A-of-origin-of-Hendrickson/2ff96ffd40c995ea407776be9d9d1fa9f17c990d"]},

Injections of the enzyme were made through a recording micropipette, making it possible to localize the injection site by physiological criteria. We found that layer VI cells projected to the alteral geniculate nucleus, while a distinct population of cells in layer V projected to the superior colliculus. Cells in layers II and III were tha major sources of ipsilateral cortico-cortical connections. This pattern of projection was consistent from one visual area to another. Pyramidal cells appeared to be the source of cortico-geniculate, cortico-collicular and cortico-cortical projections. The proportion of cells within a layer that terminated in a given site varied from layer to layer: apparently all of the large pyramids in layer V had terminals in the superior colliculus, about half of the pyramids in layer VI had terminals in the lateral geniculate nucleus, while only a small proportion of the pyramids in layers II and III had terminals in any single cortical area. The results indicated a remarkable specificity in the projections of the cortical layers. The cortical connections of the different cell types in layers A and A1 of the lateral geniculate nucleus were also examined: the cells that projected to area 17 were much more numerous and were on the average smaller than those that projected to area 18. Projections to the cortex were also found from the pulvinar, the medial interlaminar nucleus and the posterior nucleus. Direct connections were observed to the lateral geniculate nucleus from several midbrain reticular nuclei. Finally, projections were found to the superior colliculus from the zona incerta, the reticular nucleus of the thalamus and the ventral lateral geniculate nucleus.", "references": []},

Fuchs"], "date": "1975", "abstract": "The retrograde transport of horseradish peroxidase has been used to identify efferent cells in area 17 of the macaque. Cells projecting to the lateral geniculate nucleus are small to medium sized pyramidal neurons with somata in lamina 6 and the adjacent white matter. The projection to the parvocellular division arises preferentially from the upper half of lamina 6, while that to the magnocellular division arises preferentially from the lower part of the lamina. The projection to both superior colliculus and inferior pulvinar arises from all sizes of pyramidal neurons lying in lamina 58 (Lund and Boothe, '75); at least pyramidal neurons of lamina 5B send collateral axon branches to both destinations. Injections with extensive spread of horseradish peroxidase show that many cells of lamina 4B and the large pyramidal neurons of upper lamina 6 also project extrinsically but their terminal sites have not been identified. Other studies have indicated that cells of laminae 2 and 3 project to areas 18 and 19. Therefore every lamina of the visual cortex, with the exception of those receiving a direct thalamic input, contains cells projecting extrinsically. Further, each lamina projects to a different destination and from Golgi studies can be shown to contain cells with specific patterns of dendritic branching which relate to the distribution of thalamic afferents and to the patterns of intracortical connections. These findings emphasise the significance of the horizontal organisation of the cortex with relation to the flow of information through it and contrast with the current concept of columnar organisation shown in physiological studies.", "references": []},

However, following the suggestion of Taylor and Weiss 68, several workers, notably Lasek et al. 45, have shown that the transport of radioactively labeled materials can be used to trace axonal connections autoradiographically. This approach has thus far been applied to the study of the central connections of certain peripherally located neurons (specifically the dorsal root ganglion cells 45, the ganglion cells of the retina 19,a\u00b0,aa,5\u00b0,65 and the olfactory receptorsT1). Although this method does not appear to have been used for tracing pathways arising and terminating within the central nervous system, it should be possible to do this by locally injecting radioactively labeled precursors of proteins or other macromolecules into the brain or spinal cord. Indeed, there are several reasons for thinking that this method may offer a number of advantages over other currently available techniques4L Nearly all experimental neuroanatomical techniques (including the various cell degeneration methods, the reduced silver techniques for impregnating degenerating axons such as the Nauta-Gygax method and its recent variants and the electron microscopic examination of degenerating axons and their terminals) are dependent upon a sequence of pathological changes following injury to the nervous system. This essential feature underlies a number of the problems encountered in the use and interpretation of these methods. Among the most significant difficulties is the fact that experimental lesions are usually non-specific, and destroy not only the neurons within the intended focus but also the fibers passing through that region and the axons terminating within it. Since degeneration inevitably alters the normal morphol-", "references": ["Electron-microscopic-distribution-of-axoplasmic-Hendrickson/e377009332e5c76db846bf23fac269af807436eb", "Autoradiographic-analysis-of-protein-synthesis-in-Cotman-Taylor/bcc87131e21aec293f53abcebbc489f6545476b0", "Axoplasmic-migration-of-protein-a-light-microscopic-Schonbach-Cu%C3%A9nod/00d39a43c5892d8c604abb2b1debaaaadd8bc0cc", "Certain-observations-on-the-olfactory-pathway.-Price-Powell/8db1eb3a60bc2715bcb91feb8d8dd76149d0dccd", "Changes-in-the-rate-of-axoplasmic-transport-during-Hendrickson-Cowan/d5228e16645fed176c20573f4cd600075455296e", "Dependence-of-fast-axoplasmic-transport-in-nerve-on-Ochs-Hollingsworth/18f7f764429db80c836b511fba574019a5b96415", "Rapid-phase-of-axoplasmic-flow-and-synaptic-an-Schonbach-Schonbach/56349d51b9d33a266dd224d6413f614d640e8002"]},

This model (called the TOUR model) analyzes the cognitive map in terms of symbolic descriptions of the environment and operations on those descriptions. Knowledge about a particular environment is represented in terms of route descriptions, a topological network of paths and places, multiple frames of reference for relative positions, dividing boundaries, and a structure of containing regions. The current position is described by the \\You Are Here\" pointer, which acts as a working memory and a focus of attention. Operations on the cognitive map are performed by inference rules which act to transfer information among di erent descriptions and the \\You Are Here\" pointer. The TOUR model shows how the particular descriptions chosen to represent spatial knowledge support assimilation of new information from local observations into the cognitive map, and how the cognitive map solves routending and relative-position problems. A central theme of this research is that the states of partial knowledge supported by a representation are responsible for its ability to function with limited information or computational resources. The representations in the TOUR model provide a rich collection of states of partial knowledge, and therefore exhibit exible, \\common-sense\" behavior.

A contour is considered describable if the mean-squares residual associated with the most likely approximating primitive falls below some threshold. No attempt is made to accurately locate discontinuities, nor is a complete description required.

Canny"], "date": "1986", "abstract": "This paper describes a computational approach to edge detection. The success of the approach depends on the definition of a comprehensive set of goals for the computation of edge points. These goals must be precise enough to delimit the desired behavior of the detector while making minimal assumptions about the form of the solution. We define detection and localization criteria for a class of edges, and present mathematical forms for these criteria as functionals on the operator impulse response. A third criterion is then added to ensure that the detector has only one response to a single edge. We use the criteria in numerical optimization to derive detectors for several common image features, including step edges. On specializing the analysis to step edges, we find that there is a natural uncertainty principle between detection and localization performance, which are the two main goals. With this principle we derive a single operator shape which is optimal at any scale. The optimal detector has a simple approximate implementation in which edges are marked at maxima in gradient magnitude of a Gaussian-smoothed image. We extend this simple detector using operators of several widths to cope with different signal-to-noise ratios in the image. We present a general method, called feature synthesis, for the fine-to-coarse integration of information from operators at different scales. Finally we show that step edge detector performance improves considerably as the operator point spread function is extended along the edge.", "references": ["Theory-of-edge-detection.-Marr-Hildreth/f62fbec04ed3a4625a1bc4e83e6766e9b74673cc"]},

The members may have complex zeros, but it is necessary that h should have no zeros in common with its Hilbert transform h other than real simple zeros. It is then sufficient that the band be less than an octave in width. The subclass is shown to include full-carrier upper-sideband signals (of less than an octave bandwidth). Also it is shown that full-carrier lower-sideband signals have only real simple zeros (for any ratio of upper and tower frequencies) and, hence, are readily identified by their zero crossings. However, under the most general conditions for uniqueness, the problem of actually recovering h from its sign changes appears to be very difficult and impractical.", "references": []},

Next, the design of a very simple stereo algorithm called PMF is described. In conjunction with certain other constraints used in many other stereo algorithms, PMF employs a limit on allowable disparity gradients of 1, a value that coincides with that reported for human stereoscopic vision. The excellent performance of PMF is illustrated on a series of natural and artificial stereograms.

We argue that the limit, as we approach arbitrarily close to either side of an edge, of such image parameters as type of texture, texture gradient, color, appropriate directional derivatives of intensity, etc., is a key aspect of this structure. However, the general problem of capturing this local structure is surprisingly complex. Thus, we restrict ourselves in this paper to a relatively simple domain\u00bfone-dimensional cuts through idealized images modeled by piecewise smooth (C1) functions corrupted by Gaussian noise. Within this domain, we define local structure to be the limit of the uncorrupted intensity and of its derivatives as we approach arbitrarily close to either side of a discontinuity. We develop a technique that captures this local structure while simultaneously locating the discontinuities, and demonstrate that these tasks are in fact inseparable. The technique is an extension, using estimation theory, of the classical definition of discontinuity. It handles, in a consistent fashion, both jump discontinuities in the function and jump discontinuities in its first derivative (so-called step-edges are a special case of the former and roof-edges of the latter). It also integrates, again in a consistent fashion, information derived from a number of different neighborhood sizes.", "references": ["A-regularized-solution-to-edge-detection-Poggio-Voorhees/4ca46c10e34c7d9c305da308256a074e8029601f", "Regularization-of-Inverse-Visual-Problems-Involving-Terzopoulos/23844026bf30e29e2edf6f00dd1f167260d4db1e", "Edge-detection-using-sliding-statistical-tests-Souza/d8102bdcfe1909dd114bee44f3c0e6e2e6dfdebe", "Color-vision-and-image-intensities%3A-When-are-Rubin-Richards/8bf9a8b7c039e07f2e4697f4ac6ea5ba860b85cb", "Local-Computation-of-Shape-Pentland/fd7ab9b45c4e1c91277fed04f7930c4defde55e7", "Numerical-Shape-from-Shading-and-Occluding-Ikeuchi-Horn/1f9a9153f15655ea8a07186d42307d6d43032d7d", "Psychophysical-and-Computational-Studies-Towards-a-Mayhew-Frisby/d49c342e9a6916bcf77558e827ea311ea01eb55b"]},

Ballard"], "date": "1981", "abstract": "One of the most fundamental problems in vision is segmentation; the way in which parts of an image are perceived as a meaningful whole. Recent work has shown how to calculate images of physical parameters from raw intensity data. Such images are known as intrinsic images, and examples are images of velocity (optical flow), surface orientation, occluding contour, and disparity. While intrinsic images are not segmented, they are distinctly easier to segment than the original intensity image. Segments can be detected by a general Hough transform technique. Networks of feature parameters are appended to the intrinsic image organization. Then the intrinsic image points are mapped into these networks. This mapping will be many-to-one onto parameter values that represent segments. This basic method is extended into a general representation and control technique with the addition of three main ideas: abstraction levels; sequential search; and tight counting These ideas are a nucleus of a connectionist theory of low 'eve and m'ermediate-level vision. This theory explains segmentation in terms of massively parallel cooperative computation among intrinsic images and a set of parameter spaces at different levels of abstraction.

Incubations were carried out at 18-20\u00b0 in sea water previously filtered through Millipore which contained 5 mM Tris pH 7.8 and 10 Muc/ml of a mixture of 15 C'4-labeled amino acids (New England Nuclear Co., Boston, Mass.). At the end of the incubation, the axons were washed with water, blotted on tissue paper, and the axoplasm was extruded after cutting open one end. Homogenization was carried out with 0.5 ml H20 in a glass homogenizer and was repeated after addition of an equal volume of 10% trichloroacetic acid (TCA). After standing in the cold for at least 10 min, the precipitate was collected by centrifugatiQn and washed with 1 ml of 5% TCA. Supernatants were combined, diluted five times with H20, and plated on copper planchets provided with concentric rings. Under these conditions the quenching of the radioactivity was 43%. The precipitate was treated with 1-2 ml of N NaOH at 500 for 5 minl, any undissolved material being discarded by centrifugation. An aliquot was taken for protein determination with the method of Lowry,'2 and the remaining solution was reprecipitated with 0.6-1.2 ml of 50% TCA, heated at 900 for 15 min, left in the cold for at least 60 min, and filtered through Millipore with an excess of 5% TCA containing 1 mg/ml of a mixture of amino acids (Casamino acids, Difco). Radioactivity was measured in a gas-flow counter with a background of 5 cpm. Results and Discussion.-Incubation of isolated giant axons of squid in buffered sea water containing a mixture of C'4-labeled amino acids resulted in uptake of radioactivity in the TCA-soluble and insoluble fractions of the axoplasm and of the axonal envelope. Entrance of radioactive amino acids in the soluble pool of the axoplasm continued for several hours (Fig. 1). The rate of the process was linear during the first period of incubation, but appeared to decrease later. A saturation level was not reached, however, even after six to seven hours. A significant incorporation of radioactivity occurred also in the protein fraction of the axoplasm with a rate which remained approximately linear for several hours.", "references": []},

Also the position and shape of the hilights is somewhat different from that generated by simpler models.

The two approaches are the method of Affine-transformable patterns, and the shape-f rom-texture paradigm. They are introduced by a specific application common to both: the concept of skewed symmetry. Skewed symmetry is shown to constrain the relationship of observed distortions in a known object regularity to a small subset of possible underlying surface orientations. Besides this constraint, valuable in its own right, the two methods are shown to generate other surface constraints as well.

Introduction Certain image properties, such as parallelisms, symmetries, and repeated patterns, provide cues for perceiving 3-D shape from a 2-D picture. This paper demonstrates how we can map those image properties into 3-D shape constraints by associating appropriate assumptions with them and by using appropriate computational and representational tools. We begin with the exploration of how one specific image property, \"skewed symmetry\", can be defined and formulated to serve as a cue to the determination of surface orientations. Then we will discuss the issue from two new, broader viewpoints. One is a class of the Affine-transformable patterns. It has various interesting properties, and includes skewed symmetry as a special case. The other is the computational paradigm of shape-from-texture. Skewed symmetry is derived in a second, independent way, as an instance of the application of the paradigm. Also, it is proven that the same skewed-symmetry constraint can arise from greatly different image conditions. This paper further claims that the ideas and techniques presented here are applicable to many other properties under a general framework of the shape-from-texture paradigm with the underlying meta-heuristic of non-accidental image properties. 2 . Skewed Symmetry In this section we assume the standard orthographic projections from scene to image, and a knowledge of the gradient space (see [5]). 2 . 1 . Def ini t ion, Assumption and Constra ints Symmetry in a 2-D picture has an axis for which the opposite sides are reflective; in other words, the symmetrical properties are found along the transverse lines perpendicular to the symmetry axis. The concept skewed symmetry is introduced by Kanade [3] by relaxing this condition a little. It means a class of 2-D shapes in which the symmetry is found along lines not necessarily perpendicular to the axis, but at a fixed angle to it. Formally, such shapes can be defined as 2-D Affine transforms of real symmetries. Figures 2-1 (a)(b)(c) show a few examples 2 . Stevens [6] presents a good body of psychological experiments which suggests that human observers can perceive surface orientations from figures with this property. This is probably because such qualitative symmetry in the image is often due to real symmetry in the scene. Thus let us associate the following assumption with this image property: \"A skewed symmetry depicts a real symmetry viewed from some unknown view angle.\" The mouse hole example of Figure 2-1(c) is due to K.

We show there is a minimal and unique condition, the spectral crosspoint, that rejects instances of these confounding processes.

The preferred orientation and the range of orientation sensitivity of cells in close proximity to one another have been determined in order to investigate the spatial arrangement of the orientation domain in area 17. 1. A slight overrepresentation of vertical and horizontal orientations is seen in cells with complex receptive fields, whereas in cells with simple fields all orientations are represented to an equal degree. The orientation selectivity, defined as the halfwidth of tuning curves constructed from the cells response to a moving stimulus, is less than 60 degrees in more than 80% of all cells investigated, and is on the average 20-30 degrees smaller in cells with simple than in cells with complex receptive fields. 2. In 80% of all cases considered the difference in the preferred orientation between two cells less than 200 mum horizontally distant in area 17 is less than 30 degrees, which is of the order of an individual cells orientation selectivity. Each cell, therefore, will respond to some extent to that orientation which is preferred by the cells in the immediate surroundings. 3. Sequential changes in the preferred orientation between cells successively recorded are observed as the postlateral gyrus is explored from anterior to posterior and from medial to lateral. On these general trends a random variation in the preferred orientation between neighbouring cells of the order of 5-10 degrees is superimposed. One orientation sequence (180 degrees) occupies 700-1200 mum, so that on the average a change in the preferred orientation of the order of 10 degrees is complete after 50 mum distance in the cortex measured parallel to the pial surface. Assuming that 18 different orientations (+/- 5 degrees) functionally represent one complete orientation sequence it is found that 'all' orientations are functionally represented by the cells contained in a cortical cylinder of 300-700 mum in diameter. 4. Cells having the same preferred orientation are grouped together in cortical regions which appear in crossection as a band or a spot. These regions have been termed iso-orientation bands or spots. The diameter of the spots and the small diameter of the bands do not exceed 100 mum. Taking an average orientation selectivity of 40 degrees for cells vertically aligned in area 17 it is calculated that cells situated 100 mum to either side of an iso-orientation band or around an iso-orientation spot still respond with 50% of the discharge to their own optimal orientation ...", "references": []},

Autoradiographs were prepared from either frozen or paraffin coronal sections through the rat brain. The dorsal nucleus of the lateral geniculate projected via the optic radiation to area 17 of the cerebral cortex. There was also a slight extension of label into the zones of transition between areas 17, 18 and 18a. The distribution of silver grains in the various layers of the cerebral cortex was analyzed quantitatively and showed a major peak of labeling in layer IV with minor peaks in outer layer I and the upper half and lowest part of layer VI. The significance of these peaks is discussed in respect to the distribution of geniculocortical terminals in other mammalian species. The ventral nucleus of the lateral geniculate body had 5 major projections to brain stem structures both ipsilateral and contralateral to the injected nucleus. There were two dorsomedial projections: (1) a projection to the superior colliculus which terminated mainly in the medial third of the stratum opticum, and (2) a large projection via the superior thalamic radiation which terminated in the ipsilateral pretectal area; a continuation of this projection passed through the posterior commissure to attain the contralateral pretectal area. The three ventromedial projections involved: (1) a geniculopontine tract which coursed through the basis pedunculi and the lateral lemniscus to terminate in the dorsomedial and dorsolateral parts of the pons after giving terminals to the lateral terminal nucleus of the accessory optic tract, (2) a projection via Meynert's commissure to the suprachiasmatic nuclei of both sides of the brain stem as well as to the contralateral ventral lateral geniculate nucleus and lateral terminal nucleus of the accessory optic tract, and (3) a medial projection to the ipsilateral zona incerta. The results obtained in these experiments are contrasted with other data on the rat's central visual connections to illustrate the importance of these connections in many subcortical visual functions.", "references": []},

We argue that such an observer can in principle compute the parameters of his egomotion, and following this, the relative depth map of the stationary environment solely from the instantaneous positional velocity fields (IPVF). Moreover, we argue that in the stationary world, this analysis can be done locally, and is not dependent on global properties of the optical flow under the imposed constraints (smoothness of the egomotion path, rigidity of objects, temporal continuity of perception). To investigate the method, and to analyze its performance, a computer model has been constructed which simulates an observer moving through a 3D world of stationary rectangular planes at different depths and orientations. The results suggest that the method offers a reasonable and computationally feasible means of extracting information about egomotion and surface layout from optical flows, under certain circumstances.

Gilbert"], "date": "1977", "abstract": "1. Cells in area 17 of the cat visual cortex were studied with a view towards correlating receptive field properties with layering. A number of receptive field parameters were measured for all units, and nearly every unit was marked with a microlesion to determine accurately the layer in which it was found.2. Cells were defined as simple or complex by mapping with stationary stimuli, using the criteria of Hubel & Wiesel (1962). Complex cells fell into two groups: those that showed summation for increased slit length (standard complex) and those that did not (special complex).3. The simple cells were located in the deep part of layer 3, in layer 4, and in layer 6. This corresponds to the distribution of afferents from the dorsal layers of the lateral geniculate nucleus. In these cortical layers the simple cells differed primarily with respect to their receptive field size, cells in layer 4 having the smallest, layer 3 intermediate, and layer 6 the largest fields. Layer 4 was the only layer in which simple cells showed end-inhibition (a reduction in response to slits extending beyond the excitatory portion of the receptive field).4. The standard complex cells were found in all layers, but were quite scarce in layer 4. As with the simple cells, field size varied with layer: in layer 2+3 they had small to intermediate field sizes, in layer 5 intermediate, and in layer 6 very large. Layer 6 cells showed summation for slits of increased length up to very large values, and responded best when the slits were centred in the receptive field. The only standard complex cells that showed end-inhibition were those in layer 2+3, and these were similar to the layer 4 simple cells in terms of proportion of end-inhibited units and degree of end-inhibition.5. The special complex cells, originally described by Palmer & Rosenquist (1974), were found in two tiers: the upper one at the layer 3/layer 4 border and the lower one in layer 5. They were different from the standard complex cells in having a high spontaneous activity, high velocity preference, and large fields which were similar in size (at a given eccentricity) from one cell to the next. Many showed reduced response to slits of increasing length, even for slits that did not extend beyond the borders of the responsive region.6. Cells in layer 6 (the origin of the corticogeniculate projection) were antidromically activated from the lateral geniculate nucleus. The antidromically activated units included both simple and complex cells, and they had the long receptive fields characteristic of the overall population of cells in layer 6.7. The results showed that there are different types of simple and complex cells, and that cells in different layers have different properties. Taken together with their differences in site of projection, this demonstrates that the anatomical lamination pattern is reflected in functional differences between cells in different layers.", "references": []},

An initial network of possible matches between the two sets of candidates is constructed. Each possible match specifies a possible disparity of a candidate point in a selected reference image. An initial estimate of the probability of each possible disparity is made, based on the similarity of subimages surrounding the points. These estimates are iteratively improved by a relaxation labeling technique making use of the local continuity property of disparity that is a consequence of the continuity of real world surfaces. The algorithm is effective for binocular parallax, motion parallax, and object motion.

Hubel"], "date": "1975", "abstract": "An autoradiographic study of the retino-cortical projections in the tree shrew In the past few years the mode of convergence of information from the two eyes in the monkey cortex has been the subject of several studies, physiologicaP 1 and anatomical12,13,16, 2\u00b0. It is clear that binocular convergence at the cellular level does not occur to any important extent in layer IVC, which is divided vertically into two sets of more or less parallel alternating stripes of remarkably constant width, one receiving input from the left eye and the other from the right eye. A similar system can be discerned in the cat 1\u00b0, but the segregation of inputs is less complete. Though layer IVC in the macaque is divided into several sublaminae1337, these seem to be unrelated to binocular convergence: the 4 dorsal geniculate layers, two for each eye, project to the upper subdivision of IVC, the ventral 2 layers, one for each eye, to the lower subdivision; the dorsal layers in addition project to a thin strip ('upper tier') in IVA just above the line of Gennari. A recent study by Harting et ak 8 has pointed to a very different pattern of binocular convergence in the tree shrew. These authors made small lesions in the dorsal lateral geniculate body and looked for terminal degeneration in the cortex with the Fink-Heimer modification of the Nauta method. They found no hint of any columnar subdivisions, but instead an apparent horizontal segregation of input from the two eyes into 6 laminar subdivisions of the cell-dense internal granular layer. They suggest that each of the 6 geniculate layers projects to one of these subdivisions; no. 1, the most medial geniculate layer, projecting to the most superficial subdivision and no. 6 to the deepest. In the present study the object was to demonstrate the distribution of cortical inputs to area 17, using the method of transneuronal autoradiography adapted from Grafstein 6 and already applied to the macaque monkey e\u00b0 and to the mouse 4.

A relaxation process can be used to reduce these errors; we classify the pixels probabilistically, and then adjust the probabilities for each pixel, based on its neighbors' probabilities, with light reinforcing light and dark dark. When this adjustment process is iterated, the dark probabilities become very high for pixels that belong to dark regions, and vice versa, so that thresholding becomes trivial.", "references": ["Scene-Labeling-by-Relaxation-Operations-Rosenfeld-Hummel/d23b919b5c33905b23b61cdd678050ae7a1261b4"]},

Stryker", "Carla J. Shatz"], "date": "1978", "abstract": "The distribution of geniculocortical afferents serving the left and right eyes was studied in adult cats and in kittens of various ages. Methods used were autoradiography of transneuronally transported 3H-proline injected into one eye, and physiological recordings. In the adult cat, patches of label in layer IV corresponding to ocular dominance columns were seen both ipsilateral and contralateral to the injected eye. Between the patches, however, grain density was substantially above background, especially on the contralateral side. Similarly, in the contralateral lateral geniculate nucleus CLGN) there was substantial labelling of neuronal cell bodies in lamina AI, which receives no innervation from the injected eye. Such spillover of radioactivity into the inappropriate laminae of the LGN was measured in autoradiographs of semi thin sections, and its effect on the cortical labelling pattern calculated. Spillover appeared to account quantitatively for the labelling seen between patches in the cortex. It was concluded that the geniculocortical afferents for the ipsilateral and contralateral eyes are equally and almost completely segregated from each other at the centers of columns, although there is extensive overlap at the borders. This pattern is consistent with the physiological pattern of ocular dominance in layer IV. In kittens studied at one to two weeks of age, radioactive label formed a continuous band in layer IV on both sides of the brain. On the ipsilateral side, this appearance could not be accounted for by spillover in the LGN, but reflected a continuous, non-columnar distribution of afferents. Physiological recordings at this age showed most cells in layer IV to be nearly equally responsive to stimulation of either eye, in contrast to the adult pattern. Periodic variations in grain density were first noted at three weeks, and a pattern similar to that of the adult was reached by about six weeks of age. On the contralateral side the uniform labelling pattern seen in the 1to 2-week-old kittens was uninterpretable, owing to the very great spillover of radioactivity in the contralateral LGN, but the physiology suggested that the contralateral afferents, too, were uniformly distributed", "references": ["Ocular-dominance-in-layer-IV-of-the-cat's-visual-of-Shatz-Stryker/04656ba65e83fa6abd963b3e5577141125d5c2d9", "Mapping-the-developing-retinotectal-projection-in-a-Jacobson/b70c3dbd8fe844ca8bdf5e7a5ba08aa527613a70", "Neurons-in-layer-I-of-the-developing-occipital-of-Bradford-Parnavelas/214e26578e7d884377107de41eb88c850226929b", "Plasticity-of-ocular-dominance-columns-in-monkey-Hubel-Wiesel/ea2fa92fbef1ca570ae093f751ecb2e0bcfb67b8", "Laminar-patterns-of-geniculocortical-projection-in-Levay-Gilbert/fb6dbb3b713f806c8fba4d382cab6621af06d4e5", "Morphological-aspects-of-the-elimination-of-of-in-Korneliussen-Jansen/6fcaac8d6efdd3563b8c979d22cbe98b66780e8d", "Multiple-axon-branches-innervating-single-endplates-Riley/138a0088c6048aeaa63638b7a7c1f5c38769d799", "Polyneuronal-innervation-of-skeletal-muscle-in-rats-Brown-Jansen/795eba4385368c66a88310fa432ba5e6bcda225e"]},

The analysis is based primarily on the \"structure from motion\" theorem which states that the structure of four non-coplanar points is recoverable from three orthographic projections. The interpretation scheme is extended to cover perspective projections, and its psychological relevance is discussed.", "references": []},

I. Beverley"], "date": "1978", "abstract": "Inspecting a target whose size oscillates about a constant mean value selectively depresses visual sensitivity to oscillating size. The effect transfers from positive to negative contrast and vice versa. This depression cannot be attributed to fatigued movement detectors. We propose that there are, in the human visual system, channels in which information as to changing size is selectively processed. This notion is consistent with the existence of two neural organizations (e.g., two classes of single neurons) selectively sensitive to increasing and to decreasing size, respectively. Key Words-Vision; stereoscopic motion; motion perception, . movement; size perception; visual adaptation. \u2019 This work was presented at the April 1977 ARVO Meeting, Sarasota. * We should emphasize a caveat that psychophysicists assume but do not always explicitly state when they cite the result of some psychophysical experiment as evidence \u201cconsistent with\u201d (or even \u201cfor\u201d) the existence within the human visual pathway of individual neurons that are preferentially sensitive to some stimulus feature. A psychophysical experiment can provide strong evidence that some restricted visual information is preferentially processed in a \u201cchannel\u201d, but this evidence is much weaker support for the existence of single neurons that operate as \u201cfeature filters\u201d or \u201cfeature emphasizers\u201d by virtue of being preferentially excited or inhibited by some particular stimulus feature. For example, a number of psychophysical adaptation experiments might be explained in terms of a population of neurons, each of which responds, perhaps rather similarly, to two or more stimulus features. We would suppose the pattern of relationships between the activities of different neurons in this population to differ in consistent ways for the different stimulus features: one particular pattern of relationships would neurally-represent (i.e., \u201cstand for\u201d) its corresponding stimulus feature. Such hypothetical relationships might take a variety of forms, limited only by the imagination of the reader and to some extent perhaps by the known physiological facts. Our point here (not a new one, but sometimes overlooked) is that psychophysical experiments do not, in themselves, distinguish between the presence or absence of \u201cfeature detecting\u201d single neurons unequivocally sensitive to a single \u201ctrigger feature\u201d. Psychophysical evidence is indeed \u201cconsistent with\u201d the existence of neurons preferentially sensitive to a single \u201ctrigger feature\u201d whose activities underlie the specific visual sensitivity in point. But this argument gains much of its force from the assumption that one is already persuaded (e.g., by single-unit evidence) that neurons with these properties do exist and that their activities do underlie specific visual sensitivities in man. For psychophysical evidence alone is also \u201cconsistent with\u201d a number of other neurophysiological hypotheses including in the extreme case, models that do not involve unequivocally feature-sensitive neurons (or even neural mechanisms) at all. For example, a quite acceptable psychophysical \u201cchannel\u201d can in principle amount to no more than an interaction between two (physical) neural mechanisms rather than the activity of a single physical mechanism (a case in point may be very narrow spatial-frequency channels, see Spitzberg and Richards, 1975). INTRODUCTION By successfully catching or hitting the ball thrown by his small child even the most unathletic father demonstrates a notably precise judgement of the direction along which a moving object moves in space, an ability that in gamesplayers can be quite remarkably developed. Few commuting drivers question the unfailing precision in directional judgements on which they depend during their daily passage through speeding traffic. We have previously reported experimental data that might partially account for this 6ne judgement. We found evidence for psychophysical information-processing channels that handle motion in depth (Reverley and Regan, 1973a,b, 1975; Regan and Beverley, 1973) forming a stereoscopic system for motion that is quite distinct from the well-established stereoscopic system for static depth in which static disparity information is processed (Wheatstone, 1838, 1852; Julesz, 1960). On this basis, we tentatively suggested that, in the human visual pathway, there are binocularlydriven neurons responsive to changing disparity and sensitive to the direction of motion in depth.\u2019 For example, one class of these neurons would respond only to motion directed between the nose and the left eye, while another class would respond only to motion directed between the nose and right eye. Subsequently, neurons sensitive to oppositedirected motion in the two eyes were found in monkey visual cortex, though these neurons seem\u2019 rare (Zeki, 1974). However, since the two eyes were never stimulated simultaneously with oppositely-directed motion, the binocular interactions in point could not be observed in these physiological experiments. Simultaneous stimulation of both eyes has recently uncovered neuronal properties in area 18 of cat visual cortex that go far to explain our chief psychophysical findings in man, and these neurons seem not uncommon (Cynader and Regan, 1978). In spite of the uncertainty of neurophysiological predictions based on psychophysical data alone, it is encouraging to find this degree of correspondence at single-neuron level. However, all these studies were of somewhat unreal situations in that the only cue to depth movement was the relative velocity of the retinal images in the", "references": ["Cells-responding-to-changing-image-size-and-in-the-Zeki/2ac94c56f9cdd7ab7e9ba99b9473b2015c2a9a6c", "Illusory-motion-in-depth%3A-Aftereffect-of-adaptation-Regan-Beverley/010fccbc4eb5c8486550cbbda5f30893d0efdc75", "Neurones-in-cat-parastriate-cortex-sensitive-to-the-Cynader-Regan/83256fe4d2944d01f89b8cb32c17ff575a78f730"]},

For instance, it can be shown that this component can be completely canceled by an appropriate eye movement. Thus all exterospecific information is contained in the lamellar part, and this part is completely determined by the divergence of the parallax field. Thus the measure of expansion of the visual field as a function of direction of gaze is sufficient to provide all information available for egocentric orientation.

S. Jansen", "David C Van Essen"], "date": "1976", "abstract": "1. The events taking place during the elimination of polyneuronal innervation in the soleus muscle of new-born rats have been studied using a combination of electrophysiological and anatomical techniques. 2. Each immature muscle fibre is supplied by two or more motor axons which converge on to a single end-plate. There was no sign of electrical coupling between muscle fibres receiving multiple synaptic inputs. By the end of the second week after birth virtually all muscle fibres are innervated by only a single motor axon. 3. The average tension produced by individual motor units, measured in terms of the percentage of the total muscle twitch tension, declined dramatically during the first 2 weeks after birth. During this period there was no significant change in the number of motor neurones innervating the soleus muscle. Thus, the disappearance of polyneuronal innervation reflects a decrease in the number of peripheral synapses made by each motor neurone. 4. The decline in motor unit size was delayed, but not ultimately prevented, by the early surgical removal of all but a few motor axons to the soleus muscle. This procedure also caused a delay in the removal of polyneuronal innervation involving the remaining motor units. 5. Following a crush of the soleus nerve in neonatal animals, regenerating axons usually returned to the original end-plates. Polyneuronal innervation was extensive at early stages of re-innervation and it disappeared during the second week after birth just as in normal muscles. 6. Cross-innervation of neonatal muscles by an implanted foreign nerve caused a rapid disappearance of cholinesterase at denervated original end-plates and in most fibres prevented re-innervation by the original nerve. In the small proportion of fibres that did become innervated through both the foreign and original nerves the end-plates were more than 1 mm apart, and both foreign and original nerve end-plates could persist indefinitely. 7. Many cross-innervated fibres received multiple inputs through the foreign nerve. Some foreign end-plates were separated by distances ranging up to 1 mm. Polyneuronal innervation through the foreign nerve was completely eliminated during maturation but over a slightly longer period than in normal muscles. Apparently the elimination process can act over a distance up to but not much more than 1 mm. 8. These observations suggest that there are several factors influencing the elimination of redundant inputs in immature muscles. Individual motor neurones appear to have an inherent tendency to withdraw the majority of their original complement of peripheral terminals. The determination of which particular synapses are to survive, however, seems to be made in the periphery by a selection among all the synapses that innervate a limited region of each muscle fibre. There may be a competitive interaction among synapses in which those belonging to smaller motor units are less likely to be eliminated, thereby leading to a relatively uniform size of the motor units in the soleus.", "references": []},

Between days 8 and 16 the number of profiles of terminals on each muscle fibre is reduced, and both Schwann cells and ridge-like extensions of muscle fibre cytoplasm intervene between and separate axon terminals.

The common observation that one\u2019s own rapid eye movements (saccades) are not visible in a mirror has never been explained and raises the more general question of the perception of object displacement during saccades. The perceptual stability of the visual world despite saccades has classically been explained by postulating two parallel discharges from eye movement centers: one to the extraocular muscles, and a corollary discharge (CD) to the visual system to accurately subtract the effects ofeye movement from the internal (as opposed to retinal) representation of the visual world (Helmholtz. 1867; Sperry, 1950; von Hoist and Mettelstaedt, 1950). Difficulties arise for CD theories if object displacement is not detected for any displacement of a target in the world during a saccade creates a retinal target displacement different in magnitude from that of the CD, so that the target displacement should be detected.

Holtzman"], "date": "1976", "abstract": "With accurate measurement of eye position during smooth tracking, comparison of the retinal and perceived paths of spots of light moving in harmonic motion indicates little compensation for smooth pursuit eye movements by the perceptual system. The data suggest that during smooth pursuit. the perceptual system has access to information about direction of tracking. and assumes a relatively low speed, almost irrespective of the actual speed of the eye. It appears. then, that the specification of innervation to the extraocular muscles for smooth tracking is predominantly peripheral. i.e. it occurs beyond the stage in the efferent command process momtored by perception. There are many reports in the literature that indicate inaccurate perception of the paths, extents and velocities of movement of targets that move with reasonably slow velocities on a homogeneous background. The earliest study that bears directly on the issues addressed in this paper is reported by Dodge (1903). Observers were instructed to track a spot of light moving with simple harmonic motion in a darkened room. The eyes engaged in predominantly smooth pursuit eye movements. Dodge reports that the perceived extent of movement of this tracked target was about one third of the perceived extent of motion of another untracked spot that moved simultaneously through an identical physical extent but 180 degrees out of phase with the tracked spot. From examination of the photographic records of the eye movements of his observers, Dodge concluded that the perceptual system had no information at all about smooth pursuit eye movements and that the perceived extent of motion was entirely determined by retinal slip. This interpretation was disputed by Carr (1907) and the controversy never seems to have been clearly resolved (Dodge, 1910; Carr, 1935). The issue of the extent to which the visual perceptual system compensates for smooth pursuit eye movements was not clearly and directly addressed again until Stoper (1967) investigated the problem. He briefly flashed. in succession. two lines while the observer\u2019s eye was engaged in more or less accurate smooth pursuit of a target on a homogeneous ground. The observer\u2019s judgments of the relative spatial location of these successive flashes indicate the extent to which this perception takes into account the actual movement of the eye. In his Experiment II, he used interflash intervals of up to 306 msec. His data show that the percep tion is almost completely determined by retinal location of the flashes, i.e. there is almost no compensation for smooth pursuit eye movements. He states: \u201cExpressed in terms of \u2018percentage of compensation. \u2019 The research on which this article is based was supported by Grant Number MH-16327 from the National Institute of Mental Health to Leon Festinger. \u2019 Present address: State College of Optometry, State University of New York. there is never more than 16:: compensation for the time intervals used here\u201d @. 112). In a further experiment, Stoper explored longer interflash intervals and reports that the compensation for the smooth pursuit eye movements increases as the interval increases. However, even at his longest interval of 1731 msec. the average \u201c/, of compensation for eye movement is only 649<. Moreover. at these longer rime intercals the author reports that the perceptions were very ambiguous. From the Stoper report one would come to the conclusion that the perceptual system takes relative]! little account of the actual eye movement when it is engaged in smooth pursuit. A similar conclusion was reached by Festinger and Easton (1974) in a more indirect manner. Following up an observation by Fujii (1943), they found that, when a target is moved on a homogeneous ground with uniform speed in a square path at a frequency of, say, 0.5 Hz with target speeds of IO\u2019-lY/sec, an observer who follows the target motion with his eyes (head restrained) perceives the path of the target as resembling a pincushion rather than a square. By recording the actual eye movements of observers while following such a target. they were able to compute the exact movement of the target on the retina and showed that the percep tion closely resembled the form of actual retinal path. This again implies that the perceptual system takes rather little account of actual smooth pursuit eye movements. There are other related reports in the literature that have been interpreted differently, usually in terms of principles of perceptual organization. Duncker (1919) mounted a light near the rim of a wheel and reports that moving the wheel in a dark room produces the expected perception of cycloid motion of the light. However, if a second light is also mounted at the hub of the wheel, the outer light is then seen to move in a circular path around the center light as the wheel moves. This kind of finding has been interpreted in terms of the dissociation of a common group motion from the total motion, resulting in the perception of the relative motions of the indTvidua1 lights. Johansson (1950) reports an excellent series of studies guided by this principle of the organization of perception.", "references": ["The-apparent-displacement-of-a-moving-light-spot.-Sumi/6587df83b14edb8c9af349dae2ae242e90a351e0", "Further-Observation-on-the-Path-of-Seen-Motion-of-Sumi/f754569f5ea74c565d046695ff3795df49562cf2", "Path-of-Seen-Motion-of-Two-Small-Light-Spots.-Sumi/00ccb3ed748555fd8b9b2e913594364e770966a4"]},

The direction of the aftereffect and the direction of the cancelling stimulus were independent of whether the adapting square or test square was of positive or negative contrast.

Key Words--motion; aftereffect; size; stereoscopic depth movement. We have reported psychophysical evidence for the existence of information-processing channels sensitive to the relative velocities of the left and right retinal images, and thereby tuned to different directions of motion in three dimensions These channels are not accessible to monocular stimulation and constitute a stereoscopic system for motion that is quite distinct from the ciassical stereoscopic system for position. They feed the neural organization that underlies the perception of motion in depth (Beverley and Regan, 1973a,b; 1975). Microelectrode recording in area 18 of cat visual cortex has revealed neurons tuned to the direction of motion in depth whose properties provide a physiological basis for these cyclopean channels (Cynader and Regan, 1978).

On psychophysical grounds, Beverley & Regan suggested that in man different neural mechanisms mediate the binocular perception of movement in depth and the binocular perception of positional (static) depth. They proposed that the human visual pathway contains several neural mechanisms, each sensitive to a different direction of motion in space. These mechanisms compute the direction of motion from the relative speeds and directions of movement of the left and right retinal images.2. We have recorded from 101 units in area 18 of cat visual cortex, searching for neurones tuned to the direction of motion in three dimensions, with properties that could account for the proposed directionally tuned binocular motion detectors in man. The cat's left eye viewed one bar, while its right eye simultaneously viewed a second bar. Single units were stimulated by independently oscillating the bars from side to side. The apparent direction of movement in three dimensions was altered by varying the relative speeds of the bars and their relative directions of motion. The mean (positional) disparity of the bars could also be varied.3. For one class of neurone (twenty cells), binocular stimulation inhibited firing for trajectories parallel to the frontoparallel plane over a large volume of space. Strong firing was produced by oppositely directed bar movements. Some of these neurones were especially narrowly tuned to the direction of movement in depth, responding only to a range of 2-3 degrees , i.e. to moving bodies that would hit or only narrowly miss the cat. These cells emphasized the direction of movement at the expense of positional information.3. These units occurred in clusters. On the perpendicular penetrations in which they were found, they comprised a substantial majority of all cells encountered.5. For a second class of neurone (nine cells), binocular facilitation produced selective responses to objects moving along trajectories that missed the head.6. The two classes of neurone provide a basis for four proposed directionally tuned binocular motion detectors.7. A third class of neurone (seventeen cells) was selectively sensitive to movements parallel to the frontoparallel plane. There was strong binocular facilitation when the bars moved at the same speeds in the same directions: oppositely directed movements might be more than 100 times less effective. These neurones may signal positional disparity.8. These three classes of neurone cut across established categories. Only when both eyes were stimulated simultaneously with targets moving in different speeds and directions was it possible to demonstrate the binocular interactions described here.", "references": []},

The results presented in this report show that collinear and orthogonal image displacements undergo quantitatively similar raising of thresholds with saccades; thus, sac-cadic suppression of displacement is a quantitative but non-vectorial effect following the vectorial Helm-holtzian comparator. The relationship between saccadic suppression and the Helmholt~an frame~f-reference compu~tion was first suggested by Stark, Michael and Zuber (1969) and also discussed by Bridgeman, Hendry and Stark (1975). It is known from the work of Bischof and Kramer (1968). Matin, Matin and Pola (1970), and Matin (1974) that this computation is not simultaneous with the time course of the saccadic trajec-tory; indeed. objects of attention and fovea1 images are computed before other parts of the retinal image (Bischof and Kramer, 1968). Thus, saccadic suppression of image displacement appears to have functional correlates, in contrast to such various other phenomena as have been established to be suppressed during a saccade-light Our results speak to the issue of relating a functional role for non-vectorial saccadic suppression to dynamic or static mismatches in the vectorial Helm-holtzian comparison.

Emerson", "George L. Gerstein", "T Kallos", "Alan C Rosenquist"], "date": "1976", "abstract": "Subparalytic doses of s were given to three observers. Four major perceptions were reported: (1) displacement or repostttonmg,of the perceived visual world in the direction of a successfully executed eve movement: (2) jumping durmg a saccade; (3) mocmrent associated with drift of the eye; (4) increased effort associated with each eye movement. Paralytic doses of succinvlcholine were administered to a single observer. Three major perceptions were reported: (1) displacement in the direction of the intended eye movement without jumping: (2) a sensation that great effort was required to move the eye; (3)fading of the visual image due to effective retinal stabilization. Similar visual perceptions were observed when the eye was paralyzed with a local anesthetic: however, no fading or sense of effort was reuorted. No deficits in oattern vision (except for intermittent fading) were reported in any of the studies. When the normal eye is voluntarily moved to a new position, the optical image makes a transition on the retinal surface, yet our perception is of a stable visual and spatial world. Helmholtz (1867) first pointed out that if one pushes the globe with a finger the optical image also makes a transition on the retinal surface; however, unlike the normal perception described above, we perceive a displacement of visual space. This simple experiment led Helmholtz to conclude \u201cour judgments as to the direction of the visual axis are simply the result of the effect of will involved in trying to alter the adjustment of the eyes\u201d. That is, our perceptions of space must in part be calculated centrally from a motor outflow to the extraocular muscles rather than from a sensory feedback. Mach (1886), Hering (1879), Jackson and Paton (1909) all later produced evidence which further suggested that our sense of visual space is independent of extraocular sensory feedback. Sperry (1950) and Holst (1954) have called this central monitoring of extraocular motor outflow a \u201ccorollary discharge\u201d and \u201cefference copy\u201d, respectively. We will not discuss details here, since this literature has been extensively reviewed (MacKay, 1974, 1973; Dichgans and Bizzi, 1972; Evarts, 1971; and Merton, 1964). If a corollary discharge is in fact used centrally to calculate visual space, one would expect that extraocular paralysis would produce an illusory spatial displacement during voluntary eye movements. Several sources support this prediction. Clinically, for example, it is well known (Cogan, 1956; Jackson and Paton, 1909; Helmholtz, 1867) that pathological weakening or total paralysis of the extraocular muscles produces past pointing (spatial mislocalization). This past pointing is always in the direction of the attempted eye movement. Experimentally, \u2018Send reprint requests to: John K. Stevens. Dept of Physiology IG4. School of Medicine. University of Pennsylvania. Philadelphia. PA 19174, U.S.A. Kornmueller (1931) reported that weakening or paralysis of the extraocular muscles using a local anesthetic produced past pointing and illusions of spatial displacement. He stated that when \u201cglance intentions\u201d were attempted, a striking apparent displacement in the direction of the intended eye movement was perceived. Brindley and Merton (1960). Siebeck (1953, 1954) and West (1932) also described a similar apparent displacement in subjects given low doses of curare. Quite surprisingly, however, Siebeck (1953, 1954; Siebeck and Frey, 1953) found that when subjects were totally paralyzed with high doses of a neuromuscular blocking agent no illusion of spatial displacement was eDer reported. The subjects reported only that they had the subjective sensation that their eyes were paralyzed. It should be emphasized that these results are in direct contradiction to the motor outflow theory. The present series of experiments were designed to help resolve this contradiction. It is clear that to study the perceptions associated with extraocular paralysis it would be necessary to use all three forms of experimental paralysis discussed above. Accordingly, we produced: (1) partial paralysis with systemic low dose injections of curare to mimic the experiments of Brindley and Merton, West and Siebeck; (2) total paralysis using systemic injections of a neuromuscular blocking agent to replicate Siebeck\u2019s total paralysis study; and finally (3) retrobulbar blocks with local anesthetic similar to Kornmueller\u2019s procedure. Partial pnralysis METHODS Three of us served as observers in the low dose studies (RCE. ACR, JKS) and curare (624mg) was used as the paralyzing agent. Observations were always made during the induction period of the total paralysis studies and six experiments were carried out specifically for study of low dose effects. The same procedure and precautions described below in the total paralysis section were observed. Audio tapes were made of experiments, and transcripts were later typed.", "references": ["Suppression-of-visual-signals-by-rapid-image-in-the-Brooks-Holden/29a4c86c5d5e02ea5722b297d7254f004621ec84", "An-active-feedback-system-for-stabilizing-visual-Jones-Webster/6ed6990582f11623b247290ab16e7acdf84e5c71", "Inflow-as-a-source-of-extraretinal-eye-position-Skavenski/c55f8767c97a3470b2ab079e008c6b5d3cc4557d", "Elevation-of-Visual-Threshold-by-Displacement-of-MacKay/a000a6390130e352b09fb3ac79e9b600e92e0053", "Smearing-of-the-retinal-image-during-voluntary-eye-Mitrani-Mateeff/a547a2c52ffc8c7e225c666753882ffd56037358"]},

Electronic instrumentation with a bandwidth extending from DC to 1 kHz enabled the recording of anomalous looking saccadic eye movements that occurred as the subject's physiological state changed. Fatigue can produce: overlapping saccades in which the high-frequency saccadic bursts should show large pauses; glissades in which the high-frequency bursts should be much shorter than appropriate for the size of the intended saccades; and low-velocity, long-duration, non-Main Sequence saccades in which the motoneuronal bursts should be of lower frequency and longer duration than normal. As few as 30 saccades of 50 deg magnitude or a longer sequence of saccades as small as 10 deg can produce these aberrant eye movements and their concomitant neuronal firing pattern variations. The effects of fatigue could explain some of the variations between and spread within published data for velocity vs amplitude of human saccadic eye movements.

Useful vision seems to be lost in the deprived eye, and neurophysiological studies reveal a loss of binocular input to neurones in the visual cortex. Most neurones fail to respond to stimuli presented to the deprived eye; whereas almost all respond to stimulation of the normal eye. In normal neonatal kittens without visual experience, most cortical neurones respond to stimulation of either eye. Moreover, this binocular neuronal input persists when subsequent visual experience is prevented by binocular lid suture. Thus, asymmetrical visual experience seems necessary to produce a loss of binocular input. This loss of functional input from the deprived eye could result from a loss of the normal excitatory synaptic connections or from inhibitory suppression of afferent input. We postulate that asymmetrical visual experience causes synaptic inhibition of input from the deprived eye and that reduction of such inhibition might restore binocularity.", "references": []},

Hubel", "Torsten N. Wiesel"], "date": "1975", "abstract": "A pattern of alternating dark and pale bands was observed in the striate cortex of the macaque monkey. The bands, which ran parallel to the surface, were seen in tangential sections stained with a reduced silver method for normal fibers and were most clear in layer 4C alpha, immediately deep to the line of Gennari. The dark bands were about 300 mu wide and showed blind endings and bifurcations. The light bands were about 50 mu wide and did not branch or terminate within area 17. Because the dark bands were similar in width to the bands of terminal degeneration which have been shown to result from single-layer lesions of the lateral geniculate body, it seemed possible that they corresponded to ocular dominance columns. To test this idea, the boundaries of ocular dominance columns were marked in a physiological experiment: tangential electrode penetrations were made in an anesthetized monkey and, as the electrode was advanced horizontally in the fourth layer, the eye preference of single units and of the background activity was monitored. Small electrolytic lesions were placed at the points where a change in eye preference occurred. The brain was subsequently fixed, sectioned tangentially and stained with the silver method. All the lesions--total of 12 --fell directly on the pale bands. Moreover, the electrode had not passed over any pale bands without a lesion being placed. It was concluded that the dark bands do correspond to single ocular dominance columns and the pale bands to the boundaries between columns. The banding appearance is due to a greater density of tangential fibers within columns than at the borders of columns. These tangential fibers are in part the preterminal arborizations of geniculocortical axons, since some of them have been shown to degenerate after geniculate lesions. The ocular dominance columns were mapped for most of the striate cortex, using serial tangential sections stained with the silver method. The overall pattern was ,imilar in several monkeys, though the details of the branching arrangements varied from animal to animal. The columns met the 17-18 border at right angles. On the outer surface of the hemisphere the columns converged from the 17-18 border, turned medially with repeated fusions of columns, and streamed over the lip of the calcarine fissure. In the roof of the fissure they met a second system of columns oriented parasagittally. In terms of the visual field, the columns ran roughly horizontally for the central 10 degrees of the field, and circumferentially beyond that. The columns were not mapped in the stem of the fissure, the area corresponding to the far periphery of the field. The constancy of column width across the cortex probably allows a functional matching between ocular-dominance and orientation columns.", "references": ["Binocular-interaction-in-striate-cortex-of-kittens-Hubel-Wiesel/76e4b735610508f33ab1cb5148efeb20bcd19bcc"]},

Graybiel"], "date": "1975", "abstract": "The distribution of retinotectal afferents has been studied by autoradiography in 4 adult cats. The findings suggest that crossed and uncrossed retinal fibers terminate in a striking cluster-and-sheet pattern that varies systematically with respect to the retinotopic map of the colliculus. Following unilateral eye injection, labelling was most pronounced in the contralateral colliculus but a suprising volume of label appeared on the ipsilateral side in all cases in the form of dense clumps of silver grains separated by sparsely labelled zones. The contralateral projection appeared densest in the most superficial of the 3 laminae of the stratum griseum superficiale; appreciable labelling was present also in the middle lamina at all survival times used (23-72 h). Near the area centralis representation labelling in both contralateral tiers weakened markedly and local gaps appeared densest in the more dorsal band. Elsewhere, labelling in this dorsal band was generally dense, though sharply interrupted at the optic disc representation and in a curious, elongated lateral zone at mid-collicular levels. In the caudal half of the binocular zone rarefications or 'holes', about 200 mum wide, appeared in the more ventral tier between more densely labelled zones of roughly similar width. On the ipsilateral side, labelling was sparse or absent at the rostral and caudal collicular poles, and was also weak in the region of the area centralis representation save for occasional very superficial grain-clusters. Farther caudally, however, prominent approx. 200 mum wide 'puffs' of label marked the middle lamina of the superficial gray layer. The puffs were most regular in shape in the caudal half of the ipsilateral zone and these were spaced at roughly 200 mum intervals. Puffs lateral to the horizontal meridian representation tended to lie more dorsal than those medial to this line and some of the most lateral puffs at mid-collicular levels invaded the upper lamina of the superficial gray layer. The optic disc representation was marked by a column of label extending through the upper and middle laminae. Similar experiments in cat fetuses suggest that these staggered--and possible even complementary--patterns of crossed and uncrossed retinotectal projection are innate: ipsilateral 'puffs' of labelling and contralateral 'holes' appear in the superior colliculus at least one week before term, as does the ipsilateral filling-in and contralateral gap at the optic disc representation. These observations suggest that in the cat, a vertical as well as horizontal organization may characterize the superficial layers of the superior colliculus. The additional finding of a similar, interrupted puff-like pattern of labelling in the stratum griseum medium following injections in the region of the substantia nigra makes it likely that a somewhat comparable cluster-and-sheet organization may exist also in the deep collicular layers.", "references": []},

Contrary to previous reports the optic fibers project to all regions of the tectum including a relatively sparse but nevertheless very clear projection to the anterolateral one-third, where the fovea is represented. Here the terminals were distributed within the superficial grey layer of the tectum at a depth extending from about 50 mum to 125 mum and in a patchy fashion, with a tendency to aggregation in clumps 0.1-0.5 mm wide from one or other eye. Further posteromedially, corresponding to more peripheral retinal regions, the input from the contralateral eye became more continuous superficially, with tongues extending more deeply in the superficial grey, apparently enclosing clumps of ipsilateral terminals. These deeper ipsilateral clumps occupied a rather well defined layer extending in depth from about 100 mum to about 175 mum. Still further posteromedially, in the temporal crescent representation, only the continuously distributed label from the contralateral eye was found. Continuous label was also seen in the optic disc region on the ipsilateral side; on the corresponding area contralaterally, label was absent. Both ipsilaterally and contralaterally, the pattern of input was roughly symmetrical about the representation of the horizontal meridian, which ran from anterolateral to posteromedial.

Such evoked movements have been reinvestigated by many others (e.g., 8, 19, 21, 28) and most recently by Cohen et al. (5). There is not much agreement among the many studies concerning which areas of the cerebellum produce eye movements when stimulated and the nature and direction of those movements. The only agreement is that stimulation of the vermis, lobes VI and VII, evoke ipsilateral, horizontal eye movements (5, X7, 18, 20, 21). The most controversial results relate to stimulation of the hemispheres. A variety of eye movements have been reported that included ipsilateral, horizontal movements (20), nystagmus, contralateral or up movements (8), and rotatory up movements (11). Controversial results were also obtained from cerebellar nuclei stimulation. Stimulation of some areas of the cerebellum were considered to evoke eye movements without any apparent correlation between the site stimulated and the direction of the evoked movement (5, 8, 9, 18, 19). Often, the results from only one or two sites in a given cerebellar subdivision were reported rather than a thorough local exploration. The fact that there is not a single cerebellar structure from which stimulation by one or another investigator did not evoke eye movements would imply that they are represented everywhere in the cerebellum. Eye movements were not the primary interest of most investigators (11, 18, 19, 21, 25, 28); the eye movements were not studied in detail and descriptions of them were qualititative and subjective.

Zucker", "Azriel Rosenfeld"], "date": "1977", "abstract": "Two methods are introduced for reducing additive noise in approximately piecewise constant images. In the first method, the correct gray level of a point P is estimated by a weighted average of the gray levels of P's immediate neighbors. To assign these weights for a given P so that the local averaging operation does not blur the image, the presence of any edges or lines passing through P's neighborhood must be determined. For example, when an edge is present, only those points on P's side of the edge should be used. In general, the distribution of gray levels in P's neighborhood will suggest many possible line and edge configurations which can be used to compute the weight distribution for the averaging operation. The averaging is performed in parallel over the entire image and is iterated for additional smoothing. The second method is a relaxation labeling formulation which can be psed in cases of more severe noise. Each point is now assigned a vector of probabilities over its allowable gray level set. These probabilities are updated as weighted averages of the gray level probabilities at neighboring points. Once again the presence of lines and edges determines how the contribution from each neighboring point is weighted.

This belief is based on the demonstration of direct anatomic connections from this area to all the oculomotor nuclei (ZZ), on the severe and permanent disruption of eye movement that results from focal lesions placed in this area (3), and on the shortlatency eye movements that are evoked by electrical stimulation in this area (6). Single-neuron recordings in this or closely adjacent brain stem areas (5, 7, 8, 15, 24) have revealed several categories of neural activity that is closely and differentially correlated with various types of eye movemen ts. These previous studies have either been conducted on animals without the primate\u2019s repertory of eye movements (7, S), have been brief, qualitative reports concerned only with segregating the units by type (5, 24), or have not considered unit behavior during smooth pursuit or vestibularly driven movements (15). It has been previously shown that each oculomotor neuron participates in all the types of primate eye movement (21). Therefore, in working out the details of the supranuclear organization of the oculomotor system the question that remains to be clarified is how and at what level signals from the various separate eye-movement-generating subsystems are brought together.

This paper describes a parser whose input is a piecewise linear encoding of a contour and whose output is a string of high-level descriptions: arcs, corners, protrusions, intrusions, etc. Such a representation can be used not only for description but also for recognition. Previous syntactic techniques for contour description have often used high-level languages for the description of contours. This has been necessary in order to guarantee contour closure and eliminate the noise. In the present approach the numerical preprocessing of the contour removes most of the noise and also produces the answers to certain simple questions about its shape. Therefore, simpler grammars can be used for the contour description.

The topographic representation of the visual filed was similar to what has been found in other mammals, with the temporal part of the contralateral visual field projecting posteriorly and the inferior visual field projecting laterally. At the anterior margin of the tectum receptive fields recorded through the contralateral eye and invaded the ipsilateral visual hemifield for up to 35 degrees, suggesting that the entire visual field through one eye is represented on the contralateral superior colliculus. Cells located closest to the tectal surface had relatively small receptive fields, averaging 9 degrees in center diameter; field sizes increased steadily with depth. The prevailing cell type in the stratum zonal and superficial gray responded best to a small dark or light object of any shape moved slowly through the receptive-field center or to turning a small stationary spot on or off. Large objects or diffuse light were usually much less effective. Less than one-quarter of superficial layer cells showed directional selectivity to a moving object, the majority of these favoring up and nasal movement. The chief visual cell type in the stratum opticum and upper part of the intermediate gray resembled in the newness neurons described for many other vertebrates: they had large receptive fields and responded best to up and nasal movement of a small dark or light object, whose optimal size was similar to the optimum for upper-layer cells. If the same part of the receptive field was repeatedly stimulated there was a marked tendency to habituate. Only very few cels responded to the ipsilateral eye. Intermixed with visual cells in the upper part of the intermediate gray were cells that responded to somatosensory or auditory stimuli. Here bimodal and trimodal cells were also seen. In deeper layers somatosensory and auditory modalities tended to take over. These two modalities were not segregated into sublayers but rather seemed to be arranged in clusters. Responses to somatosensory and auditory stimuli were brisk, showing little habituation to repeated stimulation.", "references": ["Receptive-fields-of-single-cells-and-topography-in-Dr%C3%A4ger/f0a1eafc628e4a445f31323640d0575a1ba33b7e", "Autoradiography-of-tritiated-proline-and-fucose-the-Dr%C3%A4ger/d0ac3ae49c5013c942dc18211eaabeeaac6ca741", "Response-characteristics-of-single-cells-in-the-or-Schiller-Stryker/af0c7e6926b1eaa4b61284cecfe9258b586b1b82", "Retinal-distribution-and-central-projections-of-Y-%2C-Fukuda-Stone/2a04e85988c96a69342c3aa9fbd4be0c691d3c4e", "The-polypeptide-composition-of-intra-axonally-for-Willard-Cowan/6e7184d7514e109976dc5d8c51c7c6490c5fd9f9", "Inflows-from-the-somatosensory-cortex-in-the-cat's-Tamai/b7547cf99266fe1b4c1a552db349a52847c14f4f", "Receptive-fields-in-deep-layers-of-cat-superior-Gordon/867f172fe297f5f88732b2b86009b8eb1c9e2854", "The-neuropil-in-superficial-layers-of-the-superior-Valverde/0804d42ece309ec32de1f4edf2654ea073cca9bf", "Activity-of-superior-colliculus-in-behaving-monkey.-Goldberg-Wurtz/8896758353f1e5bb82c1da986009903e944a278f"]},

The goal of these algorithms is formulated in mathematical terms as the inference of a vector field of tangents (to the contours), and the algorithms are studied in both abstract and computational forms. They are formulated as matching problems, and algorithms for solving them are reduced to biologically plausible terms.

Shaw"], "date": "1970", "abstract": "A syntax-directed picture analysis system based on a formal picture description scheme is described. The system accepts a description of a set of pictures in terms of a grammar generating strings in a picture description language; the grammar is explicitly used to direct the analysis or parse, and to control the calls on pattern classification routines for primitive picture components. Pictures are represented by directed graphs with labeled edges, where the edges denote elementary picture components and the graph connectivity mirrors the picture component connectivity; blank and don't care \u201cpatterns\u201d allow the description of simple relations between visible patterns. The bulk of the paper is concerned with the picture parsing algorithm which is an n-dimensional analog of a classical top-down string parser, and an application of an implemented system to the analysis of spark chamber film. The potential benefits of this approach, as demonstrated by the application, include ease of implementation and modification of picture processing systems, and simplification of the pattern recognition problem by automatically taking advantage of contextual information.", "references": ["String-Descriptions-of-Data-for-Display*-George-Miller/10bd696f5ad1397fa30cbbf46df411dc2de0c7f1"]},

The carotid arterial pulse wave is of medical importance because of variation in its structure induced by arterial aging and cardiovascular disease. The syntax-driven waveform analysis system has been applied with good results to these pulse waves to detect and measure structural variations. The waveform parsing system is modeled on a compiler-compiler system and allows the user to enter application specific information as data.

Systematic electri cal stimulation of the hemisphere by the silver ball bipolar electrodes evoked negative-positive or positive field potentials in the stratum opticum of the superior colliculus. The effective sites on the cerebral cortex were found to be the posterior sigmoid, dorsal part of the coronal, the anterior part of the anterior suprasylvian gyri (somatosensory areas) as well as other sensory cortices (acoustic and visual areas). Electrical stimulation of the somatosensory cortex elicited field potentials in the ipsilateral superior colliculus which showed a constant sequence of wave form and amplitude. They increased in amplitude, reached a maximum and then decreased as the electrode was advanced deeper into this organ. The depth at which a maximal response was recorded was in the stratum album intermediale. This was confirmed by the histological examina tion with the electrolytic lesion technique.

After conditioned response (CR) occurred on 80-90 percent of the presentations, single waves of CSD were triggered by micro-injections of 25 percent KCL into the frontal or occipital cortex of each hemisphere. Slow potential changes (SPC) were recorded via implanted, nonpolarizable electrodes and correlated with the presence or absence of the CR. Frontal KCL injections contralateral to the blinking eye totally abolished the CR when the peak SPC invaded the motor cortex independent of the sensory modality conditioned. Recovery took place in the order: somatosensory CS (13 min), auditory CS (18 min) and visual CS (23 min). Occipital KCL injections contralaterally caused partial supression of aurally and visually conditioned eye blinking when the SPC invaded the parieto-occipital region but no such suppression occurred when using the somatosensory CS. Total abolition of the CR ensued when the wave of CSD reached the motor (frontal) cortex and again was independent of the CS modality.

This deficit is classically ascribed to interruption of visual radiations serving cortical function (\"cortical blindness\") and is considered permanent. Return of vision to the hemianopic field after subsequent removal of the superior colliculus contralateral to the cortical lesion demonstrates that neither assumption is correct. The initial hemianopia is apparently due to depression of function of the colliculus ipsilateral to the cortical lesion, a de- pression maintained by influx of inhibition from the crossed colliculus. Thus, removal of the contralateral tectum, or splitting of the collicular commissure, abolishes this inhibition and allows the return of function in the ipsilateral colliculus, and with it the recovery fronm hemianopia.

Interaction between Cortico-tectal and Retino-tectal Inputs as Revealed by Analysis of Field Potentials of the Cat's Superior Colliculus. Tohoku J. exp. Med., 1972, 107 (2), 127-142 In chloralose-anesthetized cats, electrical stimulation of the optic tract evoked a negative-positive field potential wave at the surface of the ipsilateral superior colliculus which reversed to a positive-negative wave at the deeper part of the superficial gray layer. The maximal amplitude of the deep positivity was reached at the optic layer. Cortical stimulation of visual and surrounding areas elicited similar field potentials in the ipsilateral superior colliculus. Reversal in polarity occurred at the same depth as did for the tract-evoked field potential. In general, stimulation of cortical areas surrounding the visual cortex, for example, the posterior suprasylvian gyrus, gave rise to a larger response than stimulation of the visual cortex. Reversible inacti vation of the cortical visual and adjacent areas by cooling resulted in a reduction of the tract-evoked field potential with a gradual recovery to the initial amplitude after removal of the cooling agent. This finding indicates that the geniculocortico-tectal pathway contributes the generation of collicular response to stimula tion of the retinotectal pathway. Topographical interrelationships between the effective cortical area and the superior colliculus were examined with the amplitude of cortically evoked collicular responses as an index. It was revealed that the junctional part between the lateral and postlateral gyri was related to the posterior part of the superior colliculus and that the upper part of the postsuprasylvian gyrus was associated with the anterior part of the superior colliculus. As to interaction between cortico-tectal and retino-tectal inputs, it was found that preceding stimulation of the effective cortical areas produced an initial facilitation from 50 to 200 msec followed by a depression of collicular response to optic tract stimulation lasting for as long as 500 msec. cat's superior collieulus; visual cortex; field potential", "references": ["Excitation-and-depression-of-cortical-neurones-Phillis-Ochs/8bf12fda1608af81035530a32cf1f711e7419eaa", "Influences-of-cortico-tectal-and-intertectal-on-in-Hoffmann-Straschill/afdabe503ab890e6b99b514b58b7ea17b0d3411d", "Superior-colliculus%3A-single-unit-responses-to-of-in-McIlwain-Fields/74953118c45e91bc099dc616164e4c1e4e2090c8", "Effect-on-the-Superior-Colliculus-of-Cortical-in-Wickelgren-Sterling/76a06db4aa61c65c29870554f538268422f352d9", "Influence-of-visual-cortex-on-receptive-fields-in-Wickelgren-Sterling/1504c6ef5597deef15f773325d5b30db9a2a9ad3", "Recurrent-collateral-inhibition-of-visual-cortical-Hayashi/601cf5e168c2921f59c5e8efd192bda11d108fcb", "Interrelationships-of-striate-and-extrastriate-with-Garey-Jones/db1f547b7c38fb511221e1666db7f8696164c2f9", "Studies-on-corticotectal-activity-in-the-cat.-of-Marchiafava-Rizzolatti/192717a22f8816ebed5da9ecc83cbf5940cbb011", "Superior-colliculus-evoked-response-in-anesthetized-Pickering-Freeman/1b381abfa484c9a48fc5ba9fff4d3b59ed263eec", "Organization-of-projections-of-visual-areas-I-and-Giolli-Guthrie/9880e37b65ccb7c810108051d11888efea6c6f76"]},

In the ventral nucleus of the medial geniculate body these cells constitute a large, morphologically homogeneous population of neurons. They are clearly distinguished from the thalamo-cortical neurons by their size, shape, kinds of dendritic appendages, and cytoplasmic structure. The axon of the Golgi type II cell is exceptionally short and forms a small number of lumpy endings in the vicinity of its origin. The dendrites are often longer and much more elaborately branched than the axon. The shafts of these dendrites bear spiculated appendages, while the distal ends of the dendrites form clusters of very large endings. The appendages and terminal clusters participate in the nests of axonal endings formed by the afferent auditory axons and the dendritic branches of thalamo-cortical neurons. These axonal nests are the synaptic nests observed in electron micrographs. Within the synaptic nests the endings of Golgi type II neurons form dendrodendritic synapses on the dendrites of the thalamocortical neurons. The dendritic endings of Golgi type II neurons also receive synapses from the afferent axons. The dendrodendritic synapses may involve the Golgi type II neurons in an inhibitory role in the thalamo-cortical transformation of auditory signals. The dendrodendritic endings of the Golgi type II neurons continue to grow in the adult cat.

Feldman"], "date": "1972", "abstract": "The grammatical inference problem is easy to state: One must choose, on the basis of a finite set of symbol strings, a grammar for the language of which the given set is a sample. Precisely the same problem arises in trying to choose a model (theory, function, etc.) to explain a collection of sample data. This is one of the most important information processing problems known and it is surprising that there has been so little work on its formalization. The papers that have been written (e.g., Solomonoff, 1964) all discuss the importance of the problem so we will forego that discussion here. Any attempt to formalize the grammatical inference problem must include precise formulations of several concepts left vague in the statement above. The four central notions are: the hypothesis space, the measure of adequacy, the rules by which samples are drawn, and the criterion for success in the limit of the inference process. For this paper, the hypothesis spaces will be subsets of the general rewriting systems expressed in a particular notation. A grammar will adequately represent a sample when it generates all of the known strings and none of the non-strings of the sample; in Section 3 we introduce an additional requirement of minimum complexity. For the presentation of sample strings, we require only that each string ultimately be included, (Horning, 1969) makes use of stronger requirements. The criterion for success in the limit of the grammatical inference process is one of the main subjects of this paper.

Although it is well known that most cell groups receiving peripheral input also receive inputs descending from higher centres, there have been relatively few studies of descending effects on the organization of the receptive field1. We are concerned here with the superficial layers of the superior colliculus which receive optic nerve fibres, chiefly from the contralateral retina, and descending input from the ipsilateral visual cortex2. Most collicular cells in the normal cat are binocularly driven by slits, bars or edges and are directiorially selective, that is they respond much better to movement of a visual stimulus in one direction than to movement in the opposite direction3. After the visual cortex is removed, collicular cells respond to the same types of visual stimuli, but most cells are driven only by the contralateral eye. The cells also lose their directional selectivity and respond equally well to all directions of stimulus movement4. It therefore seems clear that some features of collicular cells depend on the cortex. The work described here with visually deprived animals demonstrates in another way the influence of the cortex on collicular cells.", "references": []},

The main influence of the contralateral colliculus on visual responses of tectal cells is inhibitory but again some principally monosynaptic intertectal connections evoked initial excitation (latency 3\u201310 msec) after electrical stimulation of the contralateral optic tract. Removal of the visual areas 17, 18 and 19 did not cause a loss of movement- or direction-selectivity in neurons of the superior colliculus. Cooling of the occipital cortex, while recording from direction-selective tectal neurons did not alter their essential response characteristics. The response to cortical shocks disappeared in tectal neurons during cooling but could be restored by rewarming of the cortex.

Invasion of many neurones during SD is marked by a brief burst of firing which occurs concurrently with the onset of the negative slow extracellular potential. Other neurones do not fire, although the microelectrode records a negative slow wave. Depression of glutamate-induced and spontaneous firing follows and may last for several minutes. The initial loss of excitability of those neurones that discharge during SD invasion may be due to excessive depolarization. This phase is rapidly succeeded by a period of depressed excitability, during which the neurones can be invaded by an antidromic spike or excited by increased amounts of L-glutamate. These findings indicate that SD propagation initially involves the release of an excitant substance, possibly glutamic acid. The continuing effects of SD are due to the reduction in cell excitability. As many neurones are depressed without undergoing an initial excitation, it appears that a depressant substance is also involved. This may be gamma-aminobutyric acid.", "references": ["Mechanism-of-spreading-cortical-depression.-Grafstein/42434a784ce8130fd9bc019e0c7c6d4ef2872c63", "Spreading-cortical-depression-of-Leao.-Marshall/3b49313dfe7b1e3573226b335aa1beec2bd8fd32", "Rate-of-release-of-amino-acids-from-the-cerebral-in-Jasper-Koyama/cf5098c8a398134eb6b8c555aac77030bd3337a8", "Association-of-the-gamma-aminobutyric-acid-system-a-Kuriyama-Roberts/598547109455e4c2c2ab236d69d528e80fce10f6", "Pharmacological-studies-on-a-cholinergic-inhibition-Phillis-York/aec58a8940b503f351afd470d8df0791387f3589", "Tetrodotoxin-analysis-of-direct-cortical-responses.-Ochs-Clark/c304d129a308ef02e495a9da815f1e475be8530d"]},

Forty-five percent of the neurons in striate cortex responded best to oriented line stimuli moving over their receptive fields; they were classified as simple (17%), complex (25%) and hypercomplex (3%). Of all preferred orientations horizontal was most common. Fifty-five percent of recpetive fields were circularly symmetric: these were on-center (25%), off-center (7%) and homogeneous on-off in type (23%). Optimal stimulus velocities were much higher than those reported in the cat, mostly varying between 20 degrees and 300 degrees/sec. The field of vision common to the two eyes projected to more than one-third of the striate cortex. Although the contralateral eye provided the dominating influence on cells in this binocular area, more than two-thirds of cells could also be driven through the ipsilateral eye. The topography of area 17 was similar to that found in other mammals: the upper visual field projected posteriorly, the most nasal part mapped onto the lateral border. Here the projection did not end at the vertical meridian passing through the animal's long axis, but proceeded for at least 10 degrees into the ipsilateral hemifield of vision, so that at least 20 degrees of visual field were represented in both hemispheres. The magnification in area 17 was rather uniform throughout the visual field. In an area lateral to area 17 (18a) the fields were projected in condensed mirror image fashion with respect to the arrangement of area 17. Medial to area 17 a third visual area (area 18) was again related to 17 as a condensed mirror image.", "references": []},

To this end, aspects of a model for texture are developed on the basis of both perceptual processes of the observer and structural properteries of the patterns. Local constructs called primitives serve as generators for globally perfect, but unobservable, ideal textures. Study of the graph representation of these ideal textures reveals the basic regularity underlying visual textures. These perfect patterns are then transformed into observable textures by transformations which must not violate psychophysically based restrictions. Interpretively ambiguous textural patterns are used to demonstrate the influence that local primitives have on the formation of global pattern organizations.", "references": []},

Automatic generation of object recognition programs requires several key components to be developed: object models to describe the geometric and photometric properties of the object to be recognized, sensor models to predict object appearances from the object model under a given sensor, strategy generation using the predicted appearances to produce a recognition strategy, and program generation converting the recognition strategy into an executable code. This paper concentrates on sensor modeling and its relationship to strategy generation, because we regard it as the bottleneck to automatic generation of object recognition programs. We consider two aspects of sensor characteristics: sensor detectability and sensor reliability. Sensor detectability specifies what kinds of features can be detected and under what conditions the features are detected; sensor reliability is a confidence level for the detected features. We define a configuration space to represent sensor characteristics. Then, we propose a representation method for sensor detectability and reliability in the configuration space.

A critical, intermediate goal of edge detection is the detection and characterization of significant intensity changes. This paper discusses this part of the edge detection problem. To characterize the types of intensity changes derivatives of different types, and possibly different scales, are needed. Thus, we consider this part of edge detection as a problem in numerical differentiation. We show that numerical differentiation of images is an ill-posed problem in the sense of Hadamard. Differentiation needs to be regularized by a regularizing filtering operation before differentiation. This shows that this part of edge detection consists of two steps, a filtering step and a differentiation step. Following this perspective, the paper discusses in detail the following theoretical aspects of edge detection. 1) The properties of different types of filters-with minimal uncertainty, with a bandpass spectrum, and with limited support-are derived. Minimal uncertainty filters optimize a tradeoff between computational efficiency and regularizing properties. 2) Relationships among several 2-D differential operators are established. In particular, we characterize the relation between the Laplacian and the second directional derivative along the gradient.

This work is motivated by the pursuit of formal models of rational decision making under resource constraints and our goal of extending foundational work on normative rationality to computational agents. We describe here a portion of this research that centers on reformulating traditional computational problems into strategies for generating and reasoning about a spectrum of partial results characterized by multiple dimensions of value. After describing work on the solution of classical problems under uncertain and varying resource constraints, we shall return brie y to the larger, motivating problem of computational rationality, focusing on the pursuit of optimal strategies for computing beliefs and actions under resource constraints.

We have been investigating the use of decision theory for valuating alternative problem-solving strategies under uncertainty. Thus, we de ne components of computational value in terms of expected utility [7]. The use of decision theory to guide the allocation of computational e ort was proposed by Good several decades ago [3]. 1.1 Computational Utility We use the term computational utility, uc, to refer to the net value associated with the commitment to a computational strategy. We decompose uc into two components: the object-level utility, uo, and the inference-related utility, ui. The object-level utility of a strategy is the bene t attributed to acquiring a result, without regard to the costs associated with its computation. For example, the objectlevel utility of a medical expert-system inference strategy is the value associated with the information it generates about the entities in a medical problem, such as alternative treatments and likelihoods of possible outcomes. The inference-related component, ui, is the cost of the reasoning. This includes the disutility of delaying an action while waiting for a reasoner to infer a recommendation. The decomposition of computational utility focuses attention explicitly on the costs and bene ts associated with problem-solving activity. In the general case, we must consider the dependencies between the objectand inferencerelated value. We assume the existence of a function f that relates uc to uo, ui, and additional information about the problem-speci c dependencies that may exist between the two components of value|that is, uc( ; ; ) = f [uo( ; ); ui( ; )] where and represent parameters that in uence respectively the objectand inference-related utilities and represents the parameters that in uence both the objectand the inference-related utilities. 1.2 Multiple Attributes of Utility In real-world applications, the object-level and inferencerelated utilities frequently are functions of multiple attributes. Dimensions of value can be acquired through consultation with computer users. Computational utility may be assessed as numerical quantities for particular outcomes, or may be described by a function that represents the relationships among costs and bene ts associated with alternative outcomes. Such functions assign a single utility measure to computation based on the status of an n-tuple of attributes. Let us assume that we can decompose uc into uo and ui. A set of object-level attributes, vo1 ; : : : ; von , captures dimensions of value in a result, such as accuracy and precision, and de nes an object-level attribute space, Ao: A sequence of computational actions, c, applied to an initial problem instance, I, yields a result, (I), that may be described as a vector ~vo in Ao. Components of the inference-related cost|such as the computation time, memory, and, in some applications, the time required to explain machine reasoning to a human|de ne a resource attribute space, Ar. In this paper, we simplify Ar to r, the scalar quantity of time. If we assume that uo and ui are combined with addition and ui(r) is the cost of delay, we can say that uc(~vo; r) = uo(~vo) ui(r) 2 Toward a Continuum of Value Much of work on the analysis of algorithms has been directed at proving results about the time required for computing a solution de ned by simple goals and termination conditions [1]. Although this perspective imposes useful simpli cation, it has biased synthesis and analysis toward solution policies that are indi erent to variation in the utility of a result or to the costs and availability of resources. We wish to increase the value of computation under limited and varying resources by identifying and characterizing classes of approximate or partial results that can be produced for a fraction of the resources required by the best available methods for generating nal results. Let c refer to a sequence of primitive computational actions. We de ne a subclass of sequences of computational actions, c , that transform a speci c problem instance I (e.g., a randomly mixed le of records) into a nal result, (I) (e.g. a total ordering over records), without assistance from an omniscient oracle, c [I]! (I). We de ne r(c ; I) as the resource required by c to generate (I) from I. A majority of traditional algorithms generate speci c c given I, halting upon reaching a queried (I).", "references": ["Reasoning-about-beliefs-and-actions-under-resource-Horvitz/05067dcf92b7ca9bd9ca5e62b7746032d9b6077d", "Fusion%2C-Propagation%2C-and-Structuring-in-Belief-Pearl/bafbca5d6d365726d5b67ccc673a28274fc91b37", "Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-1-Aho-Hopcroft/f8ef7be3d80d1d4b001ecd9e8593c8c4954c52e6", "The-Art-of-Computer-Programming%2C-Volume-III%3A-and-Knuth/9a925d73aae2b8c1aa6b4eb2a90d2d93c8d5e3c4", "The-Economic-Value-of-Analysis-and-Computation-Matheson/967025d94fa88996534adb415a499fa2b1cb0fff", "Theory-of-Games-and-Economic-Behavior-ROWLAND/6db7156defdd83e928a114f335eef17c96217a5b"]},

Dean", "Mark S. Boddy"], "date": "1988", "abstract": "This paper presents a framework for exploring issues in time-dependent planning: planning in which the time available to respond to predicted events varies, and the decision making required to formulate effective responses is complex. Our analysis of time-dependent planning suggests an approach based on a class of algorithms that we call anytime algorithms. Anytime algorithms can be interrupted at any point during computation to return a result whose utility is a function of computation time. We explore methods for solving time-dependent planning problems based on the properties of anytime algorithms. Time-dependent planning is concerned with determining how best to respond to predicted events when the time available to make such determinations varies from situation to situation. In order to program a robot to react appropriately over a range of situations, we have to understand how to design effective algorithms for time-dependent planning. In this paper, we will be concerned primarily with understanding the properties of such algorithms, and providing a precise characterization of time-dependent planning. The issues we are concerned with arise either because the number of events that the robot has to contend with varies, and, hence, the time allotted to deliberating about any one event varies, or the observations that allow us to predict events precede the events they herald by varying amounts of time. The range of planning problems in which such complications occur is quite broad. Almost any situation that involves tracking objects of differing velocities will involve time-dependent planning (e.g., vehicle monitoring [Lesser and Corkill, 1983; Durfee, 19871, signal processing [Chung et al., 19871, and juggling [Donner and Jameson, 19861). S t t i ua ions where a system has to dynamically reevaluate its options [Fox and Smith, 1985; Dean, 19871 or delay committing to specific options until critical information arrives [Fox and Kempf, 19851 generally can be cast as time-dependent planning problems. To take a specific example, consider the problem faced by a stationary robot assigned the task of recognizing and intercepting or rerouting objects on a moving conveyor *This work was supported in part by the National Science Foundation under grant IRI-8612644 and by an IBM faculty development award. belt. Suppose that the robot\u2019s view of the conveyor is obscured at some point by a partition, and that someone on the other side of this partition places objects on the conveyor at irregular intervals. The robot\u2019s task requires that, between the time each object clears the partition and the time it reaches the end of the conveyor, it must classify the object and react appropriately. We assume that classification is computationally intensive, and that the longer the robot spends in analyzing an image, the more likely it is to make a correct classification. One can imagine a variety of reactions. The robot might simply have to push a button to direct each object into a bin intended for objects of a specific class; the time required for this sort of reaction is negligible. Alternatively, the robot might have to reach out and grasp certain objects and assemble them; the time required to react in this case will depend upon many factors. One can also imagine variations that exacerbate the timedependent aspects of the problem. For instance, it might take more time to classify certain objects, the number of objects placed on the conveyor might vary throughout the day, or the conveyor might speed up or slow down according to production demands. The important thing to note is, if the robot is to make optimal use of its time, it should be prepared to make decisions in situations where there is very little time to decide as well as to take advantage of situations where there is more than average time to decide. This places certain constraints on the design of the algorithms for performing classification, determining assembly sequences, and handling other inferential tasks. Traditional computer science concerns itself primarily with the complexity and correctness of algorithms. In most planning situations, however, there is no one correct answer, and having the right answer too late is tantamount to not having it at all. In dealing with potentially intractable problems, computer scientists are sometimes content with less than guaranteed solutions (e.g., answers that are likely correct and guaranteed computed in polynomial time (Monte Carlo algorithms), answers that are guaranteed correct and likely computed in polynomial time (Las Vegas algorithms), answers that are optimal within some factor and computed in polynomial time (approximation algorithms). While we regard this small concession to reality as encouraging, it doesn\u2019t begin to address the problems in time-dependent planning. For many planning tasks, polynomial performance is not sufficient; we need algorithms that compute the best answers they can in the time they have available. Planning is concerned with reasoning about whether to act and how. Scheduling is concerned with reasoning about Dean and Boddy 49 From: AAAI-88 Proceedings. Copyright \u00a91988, AAAI (www.aaai.org).

The advantages of using range data for an autonomous vehicle fall in two categories: first, the measurements are less sensitive to environmental conditions, such BS lighting. thus alleviating shadow or highlight problems. Second, a geometrical description of the observed scene is more easily derived from range data.

Given a 3D solid model of an object, we first generate apparent shapes of an object under various viewer directions. Those apparent shapes are then classified into groups (representative attitudes) based on dominant visible faces and other features. Based on the grouping, recognition algorithms are generated in the form of an interpretation tree. The interpretation tree consists of two parts: the first part for classifying a target region in an image into one of the shape groups, and the second part for determining the precise attitude of the object within that group. We have developed a set of rules to find out what appropriate features are to be used in what order to generate an efficient and reliable interpretation tree. Features used in the interpretation tree include inertia of a region, relationship to the neighboring regions, position and orientation of edges, and extended Gaussian images. This method has been applied in a task for bin-picking objects that include both planar and cylindrical surfaces.

In the previously mentioned example of inducing a rule which transforms one chemical structure into another, no SP relation is plausible which identifies a contingency parameter identifying a carbon atom with a response naming a hydrogen atom. On the other hand, each distinct SP relation S = {SP, Ci.q, Ri.r} where Ci. q and Ri.r are identical chemical elements or compounds is plausible. It is apparent, however, that the plausibility of hypothetical substitutions. spans a range of values between the extremes of \"totally plausible\" and \"totally implausible.\" For example, objects may change in shape, color, structure, or other attributes under some transformations, and while these attributes may for some purposes constitute categories of exclusive possibilities, it does not follow that such parameter substitutions are impossible, only, in general, that they are apparently less likely than others. The behaviors of a magician, for example, are frequently of just such an improbable sort: {{p:red, name:x}, {p:handkerchief, name:x}} --~ {{p:green, name:x}, {p:scarf, name:x}}. Thus, while one might reasonably hope to infer from \"x is red at time t\" and \"y is green at t + 1\" that x andy are different objects, this is only probably valid. The semantics of substitutability is thus seen to be dependent on what is l I0 FREDERICK HAYES-ROTH known about the problem domain, including especially the sorts of inferences that may be correctly made about the probable identicalness of two objects occurring in different structural representations. Thus, while the learning procedures for Cases 1 and 2 and the proposed brute-force method for Case 3 were entirely syntactic in nature (were explainable without reference to reality), any efficient solutions to Case 3 problems which significantly reduce the set of plausible substitution SP relations considered must necessarily exploit what is known about the likelihood that two differently named objects having attributes @hich are more or less similar are in fact the same. In sum, a plausible SP relation is any which the real-word semantics do not disallow. For example, if there is some category Y = {(q~, typ%): k = 1,...} such that the unary relation {(q~, typek), x} implies not[{(qk,, typ%.), x}] for all k' @ k and (qk', typ%,) E Y, the substitution defined by {SP, x, y} would not be plausible if x and y were parameters of Ci and Ri\" respectively, and {{(qk, typ%), x}, {(qe,, typ%.), y}} C body(U(C i => Ri)). On the other hand, while a consideration of degrees of plausibility and a strategy which prefers rules which arc \"more plausible\" to those which are less may improve the performance of procedures which generate plausible rules by a best-first sort of search technique, a total enumeration of plausible rules is required if a certain identification of/~ is desired. If Qi is defined to be the set of all substitution SP relations which are plausible for the transformation of Ci into Ri, then the solution to the Case 3 learning problem is provided by exactly the same three step rule induction program presented in the preceding section. Thus, while induction of a magician's rules of behavior, where object identicalness is highly uncertain, may take significantly more computing time that the induction of the rules of TG, where every property of the sort (q, name) which is true of an object x precludes any substitution SP relation which would entail the simultaneous assignment of a different property (q', name) to x, both inductions are accomplishable by the same effective", "references": ["Representation-of-structured-events-and-efficient-Hayes-Roth/ce84ec02c0e1f1d3cf29aa880eac57eac8a19596", "An-Automatically-Compilable-Recognition-Network-For-Hayes-Roth-Moslow/9da40f8b672a74ee64cf2cef9f3e2804fe810eb4", "A-Classifier-Design-Technique-for-Discrete-Variable-Stoffel/a9a1e5d2867543c9c8890c09702f85ef6f679527", "Approximate-Language-Identification-Wharton/5dbc148fc263f20c6e9e3aa15ac9a25869a0a568", "Schematic-classification-problems-and-their-Hayes-Roth/ae22793b12baa2741809f10c5e51bdab36095750"]},

When a result of the desired quality cannot be produced in time, an imprecise result of acceptable quality produced before%he deadline can be used. This paper discusses the problem of scheduling periodic jobs to meet deadlines on a system that provides the necessary programming language primitives and runtime support for processes to return imprecise results. Since the scheduler may choose to terminate a task before it is completed, causing i t to produce an acceptable but imprecise result, the amount of processor time assigned to any task in a valid schedule can be less than the amount of time required to complete the task. A meaningful formulation of the scheduling problem must take into account the overall quality of the results. Depending on the different types of undesirable effects caused by errors, jobs are classified as type N or type C. For type N jobs, the effects of errors in results produced in different periods are not cumulative. A reasonable performance measure is the average error over all jobs.

It may prove useful in many cases to store several belief-network representations, each containing propositions at di erent levels of abstraction. In many domains, models at higher levels of abstraction are more tractable. As the time available for computation decreases, network modules of increasing abstraction can be employed. Local Reformulation Local reformulation is the modi cation of speci c troublesome topologies in a belief network. Approximation methods and heuristics designed to modify the microstructure of belief networks will undoubtedly be useful in the tractable solution of large uncertain-reasoning problems. Such strategies might be best applied at knowledge-encoding time. An example of a potentially useful local reformulation is the use of tractable prototypical dependency structures, such as the noisy-OR structure [27]. The bene ts of using such structures for knowledge acquisition and inference could warrant the use of tractable prototypical dependencies in situations where the latter are clearly only an approximation of more complex dependencies. Default Reasoning and Compilation Under severe time pressure, general default beliefs and policies may have more expected value than does a computed result. Indeed, in some application areas, it may be useful to focus a reasoning system's scope of expectation through the compilation and e cient indexing of computed advice for actions of great importance or of high frequency, or that are needed in time-critical situations. The idle-time solution of problems, directed by likelihood, importance, and criticality, can generate libraries of compiled belief and action. The relative worth of storing heuristic default knowledge or precomputed beliefs and policies depends on several factors, including the tractability of available inference strategies, the nature of the available resource fraction, and the complexity of expected outcomes in the application area. Decisions about whether to compute or to store recommendations may also be quite sensitive to the speci c costs of computer memory and knowledge assessment. Careful consideration of the value structure of components of computation in real time and in system-engineering settings can help to elucidate speci c cases of such tradeo s. 7.2 Decision-Theoretic Control The di erent categories of inference described in the preceding section highlight the notion that a system may be able to choose among alternative strategies and strategy sequences to generate useful bounded-resource solution strategies. The e cient solution of complex problems under ranging resource constraints will require management of the costs, bene ts, and uncertainties associated with applying portions of available reasoning resources to object and metalevel reasoning. Useful conceptions of bounded optimality can be built with decision theory for decisions about reasoning and computational resources in design-time, idle-time, and real-time settings. Beyond its use for directing probabilistic inference, decision-theoretic control promises to be useful for optimizing the value of a broad variety of computational tasks, such as sorting and searching. As control decision making makes use of uncertain knowledge about problem solving, a number of interesting research issues arise that relate to the acquisition and use of partial characterizations of performance. There is much opportunity for developing automated techniques for learning and applying relevant information about problem-solving performance. Other promising research focuses on the development of methods for recognizing problems and for monitoring problem-solving progress. We have found it useful in our work to simplify the task of controlling reasoning under bounded resources by assuming di erent prototypical classes of resource constraints within an application area. Multiple inference approaches and representations of a problem can be devised, each tailored for the long-term maximization of Vc in contexts with speci c distributions of resources and challenges. We are currently studying the value of metalevel reasoners with access to several base-level strategies and with rich control knowledge about the value of the strategies in di erent problem contexts. It appears useful to construct computational architectures that grant a control reasoner easy access to separate knowledge bases, including a strategy base that contains information about", "references": ["Fusion%2C-Propagation%2C-and-Structuring-in-Belief-Pearl/bafbca5d6d365726d5b67ccc673a28274fc91b37", "Bayesian-Belief-Network-Inference-Using-Simulation-Chin-Cooper/fb7017b03db4f85906c34a4aa2fb255199065daa", "Evidential-Reasoning-Using-Stochastic-Simulation-of-Pearl/5669148e6026516720940558086def2ab92b04e2", "On-the-Expressiveness-of-Rule-based-Systems-for-Heckerman-Horvitz/16d7bc27fddb07859a3699d0563492556391c705", "A-Framework-for-Comparing-Alternative-Formalisms-Horvitz-Heckerman/aa50a753177ee9d76d1104e40bbd64db9f1a9fb1", "Choosing-directions-for-rules-Treitel-Genesereth/24e7a3d71d1414485c887dfaee087b35301e612a"]},

Little"], "date": "1985", "abstract": "The Extended Gaussian Image (EGI) of an object records the variation of surface area with surface orientation, uniquely representing convex objects. The inversion problem for polyhedra (from an EGI to a description in terms of vertices and faces) has been solved, by an iterative algorithm [Little, 1983]. The algorithm depends upon the mixed volume, a geometric construction linking the areas and positions of the faces of an object. A robust method for determining object attitude from the EGI is developed here, using this construction. Experiments show the method's insensitivity to small attitude differences. 1 I n t r o d u c t i o n Orientation maps can be generated by binocular stereo [Baker and Binford, 1981] [Grimson, 1981], photometric stereo [Woodham, 1980], shape from shading [Horn, 1975], or by differentiation of laser range images[Brou, 1984]. By translating the surface normals of an object to a common point, a representation of the distribution of surface orientation is formed, called the Extended Gaussian Image (EGI) [Horn, 1984]. Figure 1 shows the Extended Gaussian Image of a polyhedron and the corresponding object. Horn and Ikeuchi[1984] demonstrated the feasibility of using EGIs for attitude determination, comparing the EGI of a prototype with a sensed EGI. The reconstruction method using the mixed volume suggests a new method for attitude determination. This method is practical and more robust than direct comparison of EGIs.

For example, in classifying a test item X as an element of one of the classes C~, C2 ..... C,v, the simultaneous presence in X of all values prescribed by a schema Si might be criterial for the choice Ci, where S~ = [sil, s~z . . . . . s~,~] is a set of required feature values. Such a schematic approach to classification problems is to be distinguished from more typical volume approaches in which each test item is located at a point in M-dimensional space determined by its values on each of M feature dimensions and classified as an element of that class to whose exemplars it is most \"'proximate\" in one of a variety of arbitrary ways. Clearly both sorts of techniques may have advantages. Volume approaches are characterized by a simultaneous dependence on each of a common set of feature dimensions and a corresponding inability to recognize the irrelevance of some features for some classes. In the language of volume approaches, a schema of m features would correspond to an mdimensional hyperplane in M-space. ~'~ The greatest * This study was supported in part by National Institutes of Health Grant GM-01231 to The University of Michigan. advantage of the volume approach is the simplicity of the related solution: each test point can occur in at most one pattern volume and the associated classification response is trivial. In the schematic approach, however, a test item may match (containl the schemata of a number of alternative classes, and the classification decision is not obvious. The current paper provides a detailed description of the schematic approach to classification problems. In the next section two knowledge models, spatial and characteristic, are introduced which, it is suggested, constitute the underlying theoretical bases for the volume and schematic approaches, respectively. Consideration of the differences between the models illuminates the relative advantages and suitability of each approach for a specific task. Following that, simple (non-relational) and 9eneral (relational~ ~hemat ic classification problems are defined. Both a complete formal solution and an efficient heuristic mlution to the simple classification problem are then presented. A formal solution to the more general relational classification problem is available elsewhere. ~~ Finally, the optimal properties and desirability of the schematic solutions are considered.

Patterns to be recognized are defined by templates consisting of a set of predicate calculus relations. Productions are representable by associating actions with templates. A network for recognizing occurrences of any of the template patterns in data may be automatically compiled. The compiled network is economical in the sense that conjunctive products (subsets) of relations common to several templates are represented in and computed by the network only once. The recognition network operates in a bottom-up fashion, in which all possibilities for pattern matches are evaluated simultaneously. The distribution of the recognition process throughout the network means that it can readily be decomposed into parallel processes for use on a multiprocessor machine. The method is expected to be especially useful in errorful domains (e.g., vision, speech) where parallel treatment of alternative hypotheses is desired. The network is illustrated with an example from the current syntax and semantics module in the Hearsay II speech understanding system.", "references": ["Speech-Understanding-Systems-Medress-Cooper/838cb59e379c52c4faca315f3c3cd8cdd840cc98"]},

Harlyn Baker", "Thomas O. Binford"], "date": "1981", "abstract": "The past few years have seen a growing interest in the application\" of three-dimensional image processing. With the increasing demand for 3-D spatial information for tasks of passive navigation[7,12], automatic surveillance[9], aerial cartography\\l0,l3], and inspection in industrial automation, the importance of effective stereo analysis has been made quite clear. A particular challenge is to provide reliable and accurate depth data for input to object or terrain modelling systems (such as [5]. This paper describes an algorithm for such stereo sensing It uses an edge-based line-by-line stereo correlation scheme, and appears to be fast, robust, and parallel implementable. The processing consists of extracting edge descriptions for a stereo pair of images, linking these edges to their nearest neighbors to obtain the edge connectivity structure, correlating the edge descriptions on the basis of local edge properties, then cooperatively removmg those edge correspondences determined to be in error those which violate the connectivity structure of the two images. A further correlation process, using a technique similar to that used for the edges, is applied to the image intensity values over intervals defined by the previous correlation The result of the processing is a full image array disparity map of the scene viewed. Mechanism and Constraints Edge-based stereo uses operators to reduce an image to a depiction of its intensity boundaries, which are then correlated. Area-based stereo uses area windowing mechanisms to measure local statistical properties of the intensities, which can then be correlated. The system described here deals, initially, with the former, edges, because of the: a) reduced combinatorics (there are fewer edges than pixels), b) greater accuracy (edges can be positioned to sub-pixel precision, while area positioning precision is inversely proportional to window size, and considerably poorer), and c) more realistic in variance assumptions (area-based analysis presupposes that the photometric properties of a scene arc invariant to viewing position, while edge-based analysis works with the assumption that it is the geometric properties that are invariant to viewing position). Edges are found by a convolution operator They are located at positions in the image where a change in sign of second difference in intensity occurs. A particular operator, the one described here being 1 by 7 pixels in size, measures the directional first difference in intensity at each pixel' Second differences are computed from these, and changes in sign of these second differences are used to interpolate sero crossings (i.e. peaks in first difference). Certain local properties other than position are measured and associated with each edge contrast, image slope, and intensity to either side and links are kept to nearest neighbours above, below, and to the sides. It is these properties that define an edge and provide the basis for the correlation (see the discussions in [1,2]). The correlation is & search for edge correspondence between images Fig. 2 shows the edges found in the two images of fig. 1 with the second difference operator (note, all stereo pairs in this paper are drawn for cross-eyed viewing) Although the operator works in both horizontal and vertical directions, it only allows correlation on edges whose horizontal gradient lies above the noise one standard deviation of the first difference in intensity With no prior knowledge of the viewing situation, one could have any edge in one image matching any edge in the other. By constraining the geometry of the cameras during picture taking one can vastly limit the computation that is required in determining corresponding edges in the two images. Consider fig. 3. If two balanced, equal focal length cameras are arranged with axes parallel, then they can be conceived of as sharing a single common image plane. Any point in the scene will project to two points on that joint image plane (one through each of the two lens centers), the connection of which will produce a line parallel to the baseline between the cameras. Thus corresponding edges in the two images must lie along the tame line in the joint image plane This line is termed an epipolar line. If the baseline between the two cameras happens to be parallel to an axis of the cameras, then the correlation only need consider edges lying along corresponding lines parallel to that axis in the two images. Fig. 3 indicates this camera geometry a geometry which produces rectified The edge operator is simple, basically one dimensional, and is noteworthy only in that it it fast and fairly effective.", "references": []},

Shachter"], "date": "1985", "abstract": "The analysis of practical probabilistic models on the computer demands a convenient representation for the available knowledge and an efficient algorithm to perform inference. An appealing representation is the influence diagram, a network that makes explicit the random variables in a model and their probabilistic dependencies. Recent advances have developed solution procedures based on the influence diagram. In this paper, we examine the fundamental properties that underlie those techniques, and the information about the probabilistic structure that is available in the influence diagram representation. The influence diagram is a convenient representation for computer processing while also being clear and non-mathematical. It displays probabilistic dependence precisely, in a way that is intuitive for decision makers and experts to understand and communicate. As a result, the same influence diagram can be used to build, assess and analyze a model, facilitating changes in the formulation and feedback from sensitivity analysis. The goal in this paper is to determine arbitrary conditional probability distributions from a given probabilistic model. Given qualitative information about the dependence of the random variables in the model we can, for a specific conditional expression, specify precisely what quantitative information we need to be able to determine the desired conditional probability distribution. It is also shown how we can find that probability distribution by performing operations locally, that is, over subspaces of the joint distribution. In this way, we can exploit the conditional independence present in the model to avoid having to construct or manipulate the full joint distribution. These results are extended to include maximal processing when the information available is incomplete, and optimal decision making in an uncertain environment. Influence diagrams as a computer-aided modeling tool were developed by Miller, Merkofer, and Howard [5] and extended by Howard and Matheson [2]. Good descriptions of how to use them in modeling are in Owen [7] and Howard and Matheson [2]. The notion of solving a decision problem through influence diagrams was examined by Olmsted [6] and such an algorithm was developed by Shachter [8]. The latter paper also shows how influence diagrams can be used to perform a variety of sensitivity analyses. This paper extends those results by developing a theory of the properties of the diagram that are used by the algorithm, and the information needed to solve arbitrary probability inference problems. Section 2 develops the notation and the framework for the paper and the relationship between influence diagrams and joint probability distributions. The general probabilistic inference problem is posed in Section 3. In Section 4 the transformations on the diagram are developed and then put together into a solution procedure in Section 5. In Section 6, this procedure is used to calculate the information requirement to solve an inference problem and the maximal processing that can be performed with incomplete information. Section 7 contains a summary of results.", "references": ["Evaluating-Influence-Diagrams-Shachter/9e0daca0acc6ee3baf7573fe2e2b3cc94276e7f4"]},

The construction of these interpretations provides insight into the assumptions implicit in the certainty factor model.

However, we argue that in the case of plausible reasoning, rules are syntactically modular but are rarely semantically modular. To illustrate this point, we examine a particular approach for managing uncertainty in rule\ufffdbased systems called the MYCIN certainty factor model. We formally define the concept of semantic modularity with respect to the certainty factor model and discuss logical consequences of the definition. We show that the assumption of semantic modularity imposes strong restrictions on rules in a knowledge base; we argue that such restrictions are rarely valid in practical applications.

Johnson"], "date": "1985", "abstract": "Duda, Hart, and Nilsson [ 1] have set forth a method for rule-based inference systems to use in updating the probabilities of hypotheses on the basis of multiple items of new evidence. Pednault, Zucker, and Muresan [2] claimed to give condi\u00ad tions under which independence assumptions made by Duda et al. preclude updating-that is, prevent the evidence from altering the probabilities of the hypotheses. Glymour [3] refutes Pednault et al.'s claim with a counterexample of a rather special form (one item of evidence is incompatible with all but one of the hypotheses); he raises, but leaves open, the question whether their result would be true with an added assumption to rule out such special cases. We show that their result does not hold even with the added assumption, but that it can nevertheless be largely salvaged. Namely, under the conditions assumed by Pednault et al., at most one of the items of evidence can alter the probability of any given hypothesis; thus, although updating is possible, multiple updating for any of the hypotheses is precluded. BACKGROUND Duda, Hart, and Nilsson [1] consider the problem of updating the probability of a hypothesis H w\ufffdth prior probability P (H) when new evidence is obtained in the form of proposi\u00ad tions Ei for which the conditional probabilities P (E,. I H) and P (Ei I li) are known. They assume that the E,are conditionally independent, both on condition H and on condition H, so that m P (E 1 \u2022 \u2022 'Em I H)= II P (E,I H) i=1 m P(E1 \u00b7''Em I H)= II P(Ei I H). i=1 They can then write an updating formula for the odds on H in terms of a product of likelihood ratios: 28 P(H I E1' \u00b7'Em) = P(H) IT P(Ei I H) P(Ji I E1' \u00b7\u00b7Em) P(Ji) i=1 P(E,I H) . Pednault, Zucker, and Muresan [2], in analyzing this updating scheme, considered the consequences of imposing the independence assumptions for each hypothesis Hi of a jointly exhaustive, mutually exclusive set. They [2] and other writers (see [3] and other references therein) agree that the assumptions are unreasonably strong, but there has been some confusion over the exact extent of the undesirable consequences. Pednault et al. [2] concluded that if there were at least three hypotheses, then no updating could take place-that the assumptions are too strong to be satisfied unless p (E,. I Hi) = p (E,. I Hi) = p (E,.) . holds for all i and j , and consequently . P (Hi I E 1' \u00b7 \u00b7 Em) = P (Hi). However, Glymour [3] gives a counterexample to their conclusion-three jointly exhaustive, mutu\u00ad ally exclusive hypotheses \ufffd and two evidence propositions Ei that satisfy the independence assumptions but allow updating to occur. He points out that Pednault et al. had relied on an erroneous result claimed by Hussain [4], also refuted by his counterexample. Glymour notes that the evidence proposition E 2 \u00b7of his counterex\u00ad ample has the special property that P (E 2 I H 2) = P(E2I H3) = 0, so that E2 determines a posterior probability of 1 for one hypothesis, H 17 and 0 for the rest. He raises, and leaves open, the question whether Pednault et al. 's result would be true with the additional requirement that for all i , (1) In the next section we answer that question by giving a counterexample that satisfies ( 1 ). Glymour's counterexample has another spe\u00ad cial property, one that is sufficient to make it a valid _ counterexample: P (E 1 I Hi)= P (E 1 I Hi) = P (E 1), so that E 1 produces no updating; only E2 produces updating.

Instead of relying upon explicit timeouts, processes execute a simple clock-driven algorithm. Reliable clock synchronization and a solution to the Byzantine Generals Problem are assumed. 1. INTRODUCTION In programming asynchronous multiprocess systems, the customary approach has been to make process synchronization independent of the execution rates of any components. This requires synchronization algorithms in which one process must wait for another to do something before it can proceed. In distributed systems, this means waiting for a message from the other process. These time-independent algorithms cannot be fault-tolerant because a process could fail by doing nothing, and such a failure manifests itself only as a reduction of the process's execution rate [5]. The usual method of obtaining fault-tolerant synchronization in distributed systems is to add timeouts to time-independent algorithms. A process sets a timer whenever it begins waiting for another process, and a failure is assumed to have occurred if a certain period of time elapses without a response from the other Permission to copy without fee all or part of this material is granted provided that the copies are not made or distributed for direct commercial advantage, the ACM copyright notice and the title of the publication and its date appear, and notice is given that copying is by permission of the Association for Computing Machinery.

A conflict between a set of processes must be resolved in favor of some (usually one) process and against the others: a favored process must have some property that distinguishes it from others. To guarantee fairness, the distinguishing property must be such that the process selected for favorable treatment is not always the same. A distributed implementation of an acyclic precedence graph, in which the depth of a process (the longest chain of predecessors) is a distinguishing property, is presented. A simple conflict resolution rule coupled with the acyclic graph ensures fair resolution of all conflicts. To make the problem concrete, two paradigms are presented: the well-known distributed dining philosophers problem and a generalization of it, the distributed drinking philosophers problem.", "references": ["Hierarchical-ordering-of-sequential-processes-Dijkstra/c8024b97145a68df8ca08465aab82b4b437c929d", "Time%2C-Clocks%2C-and-the-Ordering-of-Events-in-a-Lamport/05a618847e4f08e5bca29dff732757779722b2e0"]},

In this paper we show several new methods for generating iso-dipole textures with micropatterns consisting of 5 or more disks or non-disk shaped elements, and we report the discovery of two other Class B detectors, a corner detector (using a 6-disk method), and a closure detector (with 8\u201311 disk micropatterns). These QCD, corner, and closure detectors were verified by examining several hundred iso-dipole texture pairs. It appears that iso-dipole constraints make ineffective all other feature analyzers involved in effortless texture discrimination than the Class B types.

Accordingly, effortless texture discrimination is based on two classses of perceptual detectors: Class A, those that measure differences in second-order (dipole) statistics; Class B, those that can still detect statistical differences in some features when second-order statistics are kept identical; for instance, the quasi-collinearity of adjacent dipoles. The difference thresholds (tuning curves) for the perceptual dipole and quasi-collinearity detectors have been determined.

Since the former quantity (the duration threshold) is generally regarded as a perceptual variable and the latter (word frequency) as a response variable, this correlation offers a point of departure for the formulation of perceptual phenomena in behavioral concepts. The object of the present study is to test experimentally an assumption basic to one interpretation of this correlation. A mathematical formulation of the experimental data based upon this interpretation will be presented in a subsequent report. The interpretation to be considered here can be characterized as a responseemission theory. We may think of the momentary probability of a word (defined as the strength of S's tendency to emit that word in preference to any other) as a quantity that fluctuates widely from moment to moment in accordance with changes in innumerable environmental and organismic conditions that affect the emission of words. Over a time period of considerable length the average of these momentary probabilities will be a relatively stable statistic, which we shall call the base probability of the word. Visual exposure of a word to S for a brief length of time At is assumed to represent an environmental event tending to cause emission of the ex1 Present address: Wrightsville Beach, N. C. posed word. The momentary probability of a word following its exposure may therefore be analyzed into two components: a component due to the ordinary impulses to emission of the word, whose average value is the base probability; and a component due to the additional impulse of the word's visual exposure. Consequently, the average probability of a word following each of a number of exposures of given duration must be greater than the corresponding average base probability of the word. A given level of probability following exposure can result either from a relatively large component due to base probability plus a small additional component due to exposure or from a relatively small component due to base probability plus a large additional component due to exposure. It follows that the duration threshold of a word, which is defined as the duration of exposure for which 50% of S's reports following exposure are correct, will be lower for a word with high base probability than for a word with low base probability. In this interpretation of the experimental data, word frequency serves as an estimate of base probability. In the cited experiments word frequency was determined from the published tables of the Lorge magazine count (10).

In addition, the evolution of computer characteristics such as size, weight, power consumption, computing speed, memory capacity, technology, architectural features, software, and fault-tolerant capabilities, is summarized and analyzed to point out the design trends and the motivating causes. The evolution in utilization of the on-board computers; their interface with sensors, displays, and controls; and their interaction with operators are summarized and analyzed to show the increasing role played by computers in the overall space-vehicle system. Introduction Over the past sixteen years, IBM has been engaged continuously in the development and manufacturing of computer systems for aerospace applications. This period covers essentially the entire history of spacecraft computer development, as exemplified by the configurations and applications listed in Table 1 . The on-board spacecraft computer systems vary from a single computer to a functional complex of five computers. On an individual computer basis, from the guidance computer for Saturn I to the Central Processing Unit in the Space Shuttle computer complex, computing speed has increased by 160 times, memory capacity by 13 times, and instruction repertoire by seven times. Concurrently, the weight of the computer has been reduced by a factor of two and the volume by a factor of four, while the power consumption has remained esssentially the same. In the following sections of this paper the functional, physical, and design characteristics of these computers are summarized; the evolution of their characteristics and significant development trends are described; and their utilization in the respective host vehicles is discussed. Evolution of computer characteristics The principal characteristics of the spacecraft computers described in subsequent sections are summarized in Table 2. From this table, the following evolution can be identified: Increased integration level in circuit technology The circuit echnology used in these computers has evolved considerably from the discrete components of the early 1960s.

This calcula\u00ad t ion is based on the principle of Maximum Entropy (ME), sometimes called the principle of least informat ion, and gives the most unbiased probabil i ty estimate given the available evidence. Previous methods for computing maximum entropy values shows that they are either very restrictive in the probabilistic information (constraints) they can use or combinatorial ly explosive. The computational complexity of the new procedure depends on the inter-connectedness of the constraints, but in practical cases it is small. In addit ion, the maximum entropy method can give a measure of how accurately a calculated con\u00ad dit ional probabil i ty is known. \u00a71 I n t r o d u c t i o n Recently computer-based expert systems have been de\u00ad veloped that store probabilistic knowledge obtained from ex\u00ad perts and use this knowledge to make probabilistic predictions in specific cases. Similar ly, analysis of data, such as question\u00ad naire results, can reveal dependencies between the variables that can also be used to make probabilistic predictions. The essen\u00ad t ial problem in such systems is how to represent all known de\u00ad pendencies and relationships, and how to use such information to make specific predictions. For example, knowledge of inter\u00ad relationships between factors such as age, sex, diet, cancer risk etc. should allow the prediction of say an individual's cancer risk, given informat ion on the individual. However because of possible interactions between the factors, it is not sufficient to combine the effects of each factor separately. The major problem faced by all such probabilistic in\u00ad ference systems is that the known constraints usually underconstrain the probabil i ty space of the domain. For example, if the space consists of 20 predicates, then 2 2 0 \u2014 1 jo in t probabil\u00ad ity constraints are needed to ful ly specify all the probabilit ies. When a space is underconstrained, any desired probabi l i ty usually has a range of possible values. The problem is to find a unique probabil i ty value w i th in the allowed range that is the best estimate of the true probabi l i ty, given the available infor\u00ad mat ion, and to determine how reliable this estimate is. Such an estimate is given by the method of maximum entropy (ME) , sometimes called the method of least informat ion. This method gives a probabil i ty value that is the least commitment value, subject to the constraints. To choose any other value has been shown by Shore and Johnson (1080) to be inconsistent, because any other choice would imply more information than was given", "references": ["Subjective-bayesian-methods-for-rule-based-systems-Duda-Hart/a47176e0ec512a450c2aed106700fdb3b5f653ca"]},

Cohen", "Milton R. Grinberg"], "date": "1983", "abstract": "This article describes a theory of reasoning about uncertainty, baaed on a representation of states of certainty called endorsements The theory of endorsements is an alternative to numerical methods for reasoning about uncertainty, such as subjective Bayesian methods (Shortliffe and Buchanan, 1975; Duda, Hart, and Nilsson, 1976) and the Shafer-Dempster theory (Shafer, 1976). The fundamental concern with numerical representations of certainty is that they hide the reasoning that produces them and thus limit one\u2019s reasoning about uncertainty While numbers are easy to propagate over inferences, what the numbers mean is unclear The theory of endorsements provides a richer representation of the factors that affect certainty and supports multiple strategies for dealing with uncertainty. that exploits converging evidence. The decision to attend to a hypothesis or ignore it is related to how certain the hypothesis is: Systems are said to establish and extend \u201cislands of certainty\u201d (e.g., Erman, Hayes-Roth, Lesser, and Reddy, 1980). But these systems do not reason explicitly about their beliefs in their hypotheses. When inference rules are themselves uncertain, some systems augment domain inferences with parallel certainty znferences Systems such as EMYCIN (van Melle, 1980) associate certainty factors with the conclusions of inference rules. A rule of the form \u201cIF A and B and C, THEN D\u201d asserts D when A, B, and C are certain; additionally, a number may be associated with D to indicate one\u2019s belief that D follows from A, B, and C. It may be that A, B, and C, though certain, suggest but do not confirm D, in which case the number associated with D might be less than the 1.0 that usually represents certainty in such systems. If A, B, or C are uncertain, then the number associated with D is modified to account for the uncertainty of its premises. These numbers are given different names by different authors; we refer to them as degrees of belief (Shafer, 1976). The functions that propagate degrees of belief over inferences are called combzning functzons. Domain rules are assigned a priori degrees of belief and the purpose of the combining functions is to faithfully represent the intent of each in the context in which it is eventually used. Some systems propagate not one degree of belief, but two, indicating a range of certainty. In NOTHING IS CERTAIN. People\u2019s certainty of the past is limited by the fidelity of the devices that record it, their knowledge of the present is always incomplete, and their knowledge of the future is but speculation. Even though nothing is certain, people behave as if almost nothing is uncertain. They are adept at discounting uncertainty making it go away. This article discusses how AI programs might be made similarly adept. Two types of uncertainty have been studied in AI. One arises from noisy data, illustrated in speech understanding and vision programs; the other is associated with the inference rules found in many expert systems. These types of uncertainty are managed by different methods.

T. to go to Baylor College of Medicine, Peter Szolovits took over as head of the Clinical Decision-Making Group at Project MAC (now known as the Laboratory for Computer Science). He renewed ties with the collaborators at Tufts University with whom Gorry had previously worked (Pauker, Schwartz, and Kassirer). The following chapter is an early result of those developing ties. It was written for a special issue of Artificial Intelligence that dealt solely with applications of AI in biomedicine (Sridharan, 1978). In the article Szolovits and Pauker review the lessons of the major four AIM programs of the early 1970s. The review begins by noting that medical decision making can be viewed along a spectrum, with categorical (or deterministic) reasoning at one extreme and probabilistic (or evidential) reasoning at the other. The authors discuss classical flow charts as the prototype of categorical reasoning and decision analysis as the prototype of probabilistic reasoning. Within that context they compare MYCIN, PIP, CASNET, and INTERNIST-the four systems described in Chapters 5 through 8. They note that, although all four systems can exhibit impressive expertlike behavior, none of them is capable of truly expert reasoning. They argue that a program that can demonstrate expertise in the area of medical consultation will have to use a judicious combination of categorical and probabilistic reasoning-the former to establish a sufficiently narrow context and the latter to make comparisons among hypotheses and eventually to recommend therapy.

Confidence limits are defined as being proportional to root-mean-square errors in estimates, and a method is outlined that allows the confidence limits in the probability estimate of the hypothesis to be expressed in terms of the confidence limits in the estimate of the evidence. Procedures are outlined for weighting and combining multiple reports that pertain to the same item of evidence. The illustrative examples apply to tactical data fusion, but the same probability procedures can be applied to other expert systems KNOWLEDGE-BASED EXPERT SYSTEMS are a class of computer programs intended to serve as consultants for decision making. These programs use a collection of facts, rules of thumb, and other knowledge about a limited field to help make inferences in the field. They differ substantially from conventional computer programs in that their goals may have no algorithmic solution, and they must make inferences based on incomplete or uncertain information. They are called expert systems because they address problems normally thought to require human specialists for solution, and This research was supported by the Lockheed Independent Research Program An early version of this paper was presented at the Seventeenth Annual Asilomar Conference on Circuits, Systems and Computers, Pacific Grove, California, October 31-November 2, 1983. knowledge-based because researchers have found that amassing a large amount of knowledge, rather than sophisticated reasoning techniques, is responsible for the success of the approach. Advantages of an expert system are that is can be designed to supply one or more hypotheses to the user, request additional information from the user, explain to the user the reasons for the hypotheses or for the requests for additional information, and allow the addition or deletion of knowledge and rules without extensive reprogramming. A recent survey article by Gevarter (1983) discusses expert system applications in areas such as medical diagnosis, geology, and computer configuration analysis and evaluates the limitations of current systems. Limitations exist on the current use of expert systems because formalizing the knowledge of experts is a difficult task; building the system is laborious and timeconsuming; operation is effective only in a relatively limited field; and degradation is not always graceful when problems are outside of the limited field. Newer expert systems are being developed that find ways around these limitations, and future use and growth of expert systems should increase. Duda and Shortliffe (1983) discuss current research in expert systems, while the book edited by Barr and Feigenbaum (1982) presents more detailed material.

Multiple sensor inputs need to be interpreted in a timely manner to assess developing battlefield conditions. The high volume of data from such sensor systems, as well as their high rate of data transfer, make this timely interpretation difficult and very demanding of human resources. A system that could process routine messages automatically would free the human intelligence analyst to concentrate on more difficult data interpretation tasks As part of an effort to implement a computer expert systern to aid in tactical data fusion, a project was initiated at the Palo Alto Research Laboratory to study potential languages and architecture that could contribute to the development of this system. This effort, which is still in its initial stages, led to the development of a small prototype expert system program written in PROLOG Most existing expert systems have been written in LISP The language PROLOG is described in Clocksin and Mellish (1981), and its use for writing expert systems is described in Clark and McCabe (1980) and in Mizoguchi (1983). The prototype system, called EXPRS (Expert PRolog System), has a number of interesting and powerful features. This system was implemented using the DEC-10 version of PROLOG (Pereira et al 1979), and is being translated to the TJniversity of Sussex POPLOG version of PROLOG on the VAX 1 l/780 (Hardy 1983).

In particular it reviews the philosophical and logical antecedents and foundations for this theory and its applications. The problem of borderline cases in set theory and the two classical approaches ofpreeisifying them out, or admitting them as a third case, are discussed, leading to Zadeh's suggestion of continuous degrees of set membership. The extension of basic set operations to such fuzzy sets, and the relationship to other multivalued logics for set theory, are then outlined. Thefuzzification of mathematical structures leads naturally to the concepts of fuzzy logics and inference, and consideration of implication suggests Lukasiewicz infinite-valued logic as a base logic for fuzzy reasoning. The paradoxes of the barber, and of sorites, are then analysed to illustrate fuzzy reasoning in action and lead naturally to Zadeh's theory of linguistic hedges and truth. Finally, the logical, modeltheoretic and psychological derivations of numeric values in fuzzy reasoning are discussed, and the rationale behind interest in fuzzy reasoning is summarized.", "references": ["System-Identification-%2C-Approximation-and-Gaines/e8371410e77629cc21d47f0e0706dd0fa4988fc3", "Fuzzy-Reasoning-and-the-Logics-of-Uncertainty-Gaines/36dfb50df3cad7f9c06148829fa4ae37e8321174"]},

Among the hallmarks of natural dialogs are unexpected and seemingly unpredictable sequences of events. We describe some of the forms that these can take below. \"We then go on to discuss the modular design which makes the system re!atively insensitive t o the vagaries of ordinary conversation. 1.1. Problems of natural dialog The simple dialog shown in Fig. 1 illustrates some of the language-understanding problems we attacked. (The parenthesized numbers are for reference in the text). The problems illustrated in this figure, and described in the paragraphs below, include allowing both the client and the system to take the initiative, understanding indirect answers to questions, resolving anaphora, understanding fragments of sentences offered as answers to questions, and interpreting the discourse in the light of known conversational patterns. 1.1.1. Mixed initiative A typical contribution to a dialog, in addition to its more obvious functions, conveys an expectation about how the other participant will respond. This is clearest in the ease of a question, but it is true of all dialog. If one of the participants has very particular expectations and states them strongly whenever he speaks, and ff the other always responds in such a way as to meet the expectations conveyed, then the initiative remains with the first participant throughout. The success of interactive computer systems can often be traced to the skill with which their designers were able to assure them such a dominating position in the interaction. In natural conversations between humans, however, each participant usually assumes the initiative from time to time. Either clear expectations are not stated or simply not honored. GUS attempts to retain the initiative, but not to the extent of jeopardizing the natural flow of the conversation. To this extent it is a mixed-initiative system (see Carbonell [5, 6]). This is exemplified in the dialogue at (1) where the client volunteers more information than GUS requested. In addition to his destination, the client gives the date on which he wants to travel. Line (3) illustrates a ease where the client takes control of the conversation. GUS had found a potentially acceptable flight and asked for the client's approval. Instead of either giving or denying it, the client replied with a question of his own. 1.1.2. Indirect answers It is by no means always clear what constitutes an answer to a question. Frequently the purported answer is at best only a basis on which to infer the information requested. For example, when ous asks \"Whatt ime do you want to leave?\" it is seeking information to constrain the selection of a flight, client's res onse t o \u2022 \u2022 P \" . this question, a t (2), does constrain the flight selection, b u t only indirectly.

Gaines"], "date": "1977", "abstract": "This paper is concerned with establishing broadly-based system-theoretic foundations and practical techniques for the problem of system identification that are rigorous, intuitively clear and conceptually powerful. A general formulation is first given in which two order relations are postulated on a class of models: a constant one of complexity; and a variable one of approximation induced by an observed behaviour. An admissible model is such that any less complex model is a worse approximation. The general problem of identification is that of finding the admissible subspace of models induced by a given behaviour. It is proved under very general assumptions that, if deterministic models are required then nearly all behaviours require models of nearly maximum complexity. A general theory of approximation between models and behaviour is then developed based on subjective probability concepts and semantic information theory The role of structural constraints such as causality, locality, finite memory, etc., are then discussed as rules of the game. These concepts and results are applied to the specific problem or stochastic automaton, or grammar, inference. Computational results are given to demonstrate that the theory is complete and fully operational. Finally the formulation of identification proposed in this paper is analysed in terms of Klir\u2019s epistemological hierarchy and both are discussed in terms of the rich philosophical literature on the acquisition of knowledge.", "references": []},

This technique, known as hybrid redundancy, consists of N identical modules connected to a majority voter to form an NMR core. Disagreement detectors instruct a switch to replace any of the N modules that disagree with the majority consensus by a standby spare. The switch is essential to the operation of the hybrid redundancy scheme. The system reliability is a product of the reliabilities of the switch and the hybrid redundancy scheme assuming a perfect switch. To realize the demonstrated potential of the latter a highly reliable, thus simple, switch is required. An iterative cell switch is proposed and demonstrated to save at least 25 percent, and more than 80 percent in some instances, of the complexity of a switch design presented elsewhere in the literature. The use of threshold, rather than majority, voters is considered and shown to yield a simpler design in some cases. Three techniques for decreasing the propagation delay through the iterative cell switch are presented as well as a scheme to implement retry of failed modules.

The model reflects both the program's knowledge of pharmacokinetics and those special features of the patient's condition which may alter his response to therapy. The program makes assessments of the therapeutic and the toxic effects of digitalis on the patient, and bases its subsequent recommendations on the \"therapeutic-toxic\" state which best describes the evolving clinical situation.

Cohen", "Mark D. Lieberman"], "date": "1983", "abstract": "FOLIO is an expert system to assist portfolio managers. It interviews a client and, on the basis of expert knowledge, determines the client's investment goals and the portfolio that best meets them. FOLIO is a test bed for a theory of heuristic reasoning about uncertainty (Cohen and Grinberg, 1983), and its task has many parallels to established Al paradigms such as diagnosis in medicine and construction of a student model in ICAI domains. FOLIO uses a goal programming algorithm (Hillier and Lieberman, 1980) as a relaxation method for resolving the client's multiple goals into a portfolio that fits them optimally. This paper discusses the motivations for building FOLIO; its task, design, and operation; and examples of its recommendations. Mot iva l ionsfor FOLIO Modern portfolio theory (Rudd and Clasing, 1982; Sharpe, 1981) is currently applied by large institutions to problems of asset allocation for large clients, such as pension funds, as well as for small, individual clients. The central idea of these applications is to divide up the c l ients assets between several funds that have different characteristics. The relevant characteristics of the client are the client's desired risk and return; given these, an optimum allocation of assets can be found with a quadratic programming algorithm (Sharpe, 1970). Other characteristics of the client, besides those associated with risk and return, can enter into the problem but in practice are rarely considered. This may be because it is difficult to assess these factors accurately. The client's risk tolerance is uncertain, as is his or her tax status, asset structure, and investment goals. The information provided by the client is often incomplete and inaccurate, and sometimes it is even contradictory. Thus, no matter how sophisticated an asset allocation algorithm is, its recommendations are subject to the same suspicion as the data on which they are based. Our goal in the FOLIO project has been to develop an asset allocation program that is sensitive to the uncertainty implicit in client data. Our research takes two paths: first, our work on an expert system to interview a client and recommend a portfolio and, second, our development of a theory of heuristic reasoning about the uncertainty that arises during the interview. This paper discusses the expert system research. The Asset Al location Problem FOLIO'S tasks are to figure out what the client needs, and to allocate his or her assets. Asset allocation is a simplification of the more general problem of portfolio management, because the goal is to allocate a client's assets to one or more funds of securities, rather than to individual securities. FOLIO recognizes nine funds (or classes) of securities. These include dividendoriented, low risk stocks, government and highly rated taxable bonds of mixed maturities, tax free municipal bonds, growth stocks, and others. FOLIO infers the client's goals during an interview and, at the end, compose:; i: portfolio of shares in each fund. This composition is guaranteed to provide an optimum fit to the client's goals. FOLIO leaves the investment advisor free to instantiate its recommendations with particular securities. Since asset allocation involves shares in funds of securities, FOLIO requires only aggregate knowledge about the properties of the securities in each fund; for example, it knows the average riskiness and rate of leiurn for the entire fund, not for individual securities within it. This has three important consequences. First, the program need not know thousands of stocks and bonds individually and intimately. Second, since aggregate figures change more slowly than those for individual securities, FOLIO can be kept current without perpetually changing parameter values for large numbers of securities. Third, the responsibility for security analysis rests with the investment advisor, not with FOLIO. The St ructure of FOLIO FOLIO has three main components: a set of interview functions, a forward-chaining production system for inferring the client's goals, and a goal programming algorithm to maximize the fit of the client's portfolio to his goals. The inierview functions are very simple, distinguished only by an editor to allow the client to change his answers. Since most clients are asked the same questions, each client is asked all the questions at the beginning of the consultation. FOLIO uses a goal programming algorithm to maximize the fit of a portfolio to the goals that the portfolio is supposed to satisfy. Goal programming is a kind of linear programming in which the ubjective function is made up of terms describing the deviations from the target values of each goal. The result is a solution that minimizes the summed deviation from all the goals. Fourteen goals received much discussion. These include hedges, goals for different kinds of income, and goals for acceptable degrees of risk. Each goal is represented by five parameters: a target value that is more desirable than any other; a penalty for exceeding the target value, which is a monotonically nondecreasing function of the difference between the target value and the actual value; a similar penalty for falling short of the target P. Cohen and M. Lieberman 213 value; a lower bound, below which the penalty becomes infinite; and an upper bound, above which the penalty becomes infinite. These parameters are described by four linear constraints on each goal:", "references": ["A-Theory-of-Heuristic-Reasoning-About-Uncertainty-Cohen-Grinberg/68aac48cfb9a5189c5e1afa7a14d4c7fe65f11d4"]},

A basic multivalued logic is developed in terms of a truth function over a lattice of propositions that encompasses a wide range of logics of uncertainty. Various degrees of truth functionality are then defined and used to derive specific logics including probability logic and Lukasiewicz infinitely valued logic.

In such cases. no result except the approximate results produced by the computation up to that point will be available. It is desirable to utilize these imprecise results if possible. We propose two approaches to enable computations to return imprecise results when executions cannot be completed normally. The milestone approach records results periodically. and if a deadline is reached, returns the last recorded result. The sieve approach demarcates sections of code which can be skipped if the time available is insufficient. By using these approaches, the system is able to produce imprecise results when deadlines are reached. We describe the design of the Concord project which supports imprecise computations using these techniques. We also present a general model of imprecise computations which takes into account the influence of the environment, and show where our approach fits into this model.", "references": ["Scheduling-Real-Time%2C-Periodic-Jobs-Using-Imprecise-Liu-Lin/2bf3973a5804752d8a6868a734a8809e470c6ec6", "Real-Time-Euclid%3A-A-language-for-reliable-real-time-Kligerman-Stoyen/13f4e57851f8eaa1ff895418dd44a49368342993", "A-method-and-a-language-for-constructing-iterative-Finance-Souqui%C3%A8res/a95589824750d0ea5dd7fbede1a1a8ef389ed5f2", "Scheduling-subject-to-resource-constraints%3A-and-Blazewicz-Lenstra/114ff5c219c5a2fb12eee2360d192659c75c1790", "On-Development-of-Iterative-Programs-from-Function-Basu/436db4cfda67355bc715356722cdc6af4f844b46", "Exception-Handling%3A-Issues-and-a-Proposed-Notation-Goodenough/5300f92dba234f183230d656a4dc16d9cbda9f73"]},

An introduction to some aspects of these metaphors is given which simultaneously serves as a guest editorial for a special issue devoted to the topic. The ubiquity of a distributed mode of computation in information processing in natural phenomena in general and in human societies in particular is observed and related to the evolutionary and complexity-reducing advantages of this mode. The forms of communication media available to coordinate the problem solving activities of the individual processors are examined. Some general remarks are made on how problem solving is distributed and coordinated in some human organizations, and the potential usefulness of the \" society of specialists\" notion in explicating cognitive activity is pointed out. Along the way, the contents of the papers in the special issue are considered in relation to various points raised in the discussion.", "references": []},
